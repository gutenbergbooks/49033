Introduction
</p>

<p>
The sun goes down, for those alone, who
stand on a revolving sphere: and so, in
Nature's universal life, Death is but a dissolving
view, a word without a meaning: real only to
the accidental unit, to whose local and
momentary combination it sets a term.  Death is a
thing of nought, phenomenal, kaleidoscopic:
a juggle of the Mother of Illusion, Prakriti or
Máyá, whose magic scene not only never dies,
but like her own wild animals, sleeps even
with an open eye.  You never catch her
napping.  And often, when you think that you
have done it, she winks at you, just as it were
to show you your mistake.  As sometimes, on
a hot midsummer day, when the delicate blue
smoke from cottage chimneys rises straight
into the air, and Nature holds her breath: you
think, she is asleep: and all at once, there
comes a little whisper, and a ripple passes
over all the golden ears of corn, and in another
moment, all is still.  Or on a cliff that
overhangs a glassy sea, you lie and dream, and
think, the very water sleeps: and then, a
sudden change of colour flushes the ocean opal
for only a single instant, and is gone.  Or in
a wood at noon, you listen to the silence, and
a rustle suddenly quivers in the trees, and dies
away.  Murmurs and echoes: moments and
emotions of the pulses of the world: hints and
indications, still, small voices more significant
than storms, of the never-sleeping thrill and
throb of universal action.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Every tremor gravitation excites in any
planet is immediately transmitted to the
farthest limits of the system, in oscillations
corresponding in their periods with the causes that
produce them, like sympathetic notes in music,
or vibrations from the deep tones of an
organ....  The human frame may be
regarded as an elastic system, the different
parts of which are capable of receiving the
tremors of elastic media, and of vibrating in
unison with their innumerable undulations.</i>"
</p>

<p>
So far sober modern science, never dreaming
that it is exactly reproducing (translate
the thing only from physics into ethics) the
old Hindoo idea, that moral conservation of
energy, whose fundamental axiom it is, that
no ACTION, good or bad, however small, is
or ever can be lost, but like a stone thrown
into the water, generates innumerable
consequences, running in all directions to infinity,
producing permanent impressions and effects,
that follow and fatally determine, eternal and
indelible, the fortunes of their DOER, through
the series of interminable births and deaths:
births that are no beginning, and deaths that
are not an end.  Thus do we go on making for
ourselves our weal or woe: and as we go, <i>the
hounds of deeds long buried in oblivion are on
our track</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Doubtless a little story might have a more
delicious name than the one before us: but
doubtless it never had.  We may understand
it either of a young woman or the moon: and
in either case, it means more things than one.
I.  <i>The new moon, seen for a single instant,
in the sky, or on the lotus, or on the forehead
of Maheshwara</i>.  II.  <i>A beauty with eyes like
a great blue lotus, or the colour of heaven</i>.
For all these things have a quality in common,
the mystic blue.
</p>

<p>
Strange, how deep an impression the colour
<i>blue</i> seems to have made upon the Indian
mind.  Gods and peacocks, creepers and
lotuses, clouds and pools and skies and seas,
elephants and maidens' glances are all mixed
up together in their language by their
"participation" in this "Platonic idea," this
transcendental blue.  Something of this, indeed,
is readily intelligible in every land: but in
India, it is more so.  The blue is bluer, there.
<i>Wouldst the poet understand, Travel in the
poet's land</i>.  I will not say, with Goethe,
Kenst thou that land: but simply tell the
reader something that I saw at Mahabaleshwar
in 1903.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The month of May, and with it, the hot
weather, was drawing to a close.  The woods
were green, but very, very dry, and all their
ferny fringes by the red road-sides were parched
and powdered thick with ruddy dust.  Each
morning, when I stood in my verandah, looking
down the valley, I could see a floor of cloud,
now rolled out like a table-cloth, now tossing
like a troubled sea, now floating, wreath on
wreath, like a ballet dancer's gauzy flounces,
half opaque and half transparent, over the
distant Konkan, three thousand feet and more
below, waiting for the rising sun to touch it
with a rosy blush and kiss it, into invisibility.
And every evening, just as he went away, the
hot haze hanging like a filmy veil about the
hills thickened back into solidity, and beautiful
cold mists, reborn, rolled swiftly up the
valley, blotting out the picture, and hiding all
with their ghostly shifting curtain.  And so,
from morn to night, and night to morning, it
went on, till lines of bullock carts began to
gather and wander down the hill, and people
were preparing to pack and flit and vanish:
for the monsoon was approaching, when no
one not a native of those parts can remain
upon the hill, unless he wishes to go mad.
</p>

<p>
And then it began to rain.  Suddenly, like
the Day of Judgment, there fell from the sky
in a solid lump rain, like no rain that I had
ever seen before, with the roar of an avalanche
and the thunder of Indra and lightning that
hissed like a serpent, crashing and smashing
down on the roof as if it would break it in.
It was dark at midday, and deadly cold, for
there went up a mist from the earth, to meet
the flood from heaven, making as it were a
solid wall through which it was impossible to
see a yard.  There was nothing to be done but
to sit and wait.  So for five nights and days
that angry rain raged and hammered upon
the earth, and tore her with savage fury, growing
fiercer as it went on[<a id="chap00bfn1text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn1">1</a>]: till all at once, just
as though the gates above had been suddenly
shut, it stopped, as abruptly as it had begun,
about five in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
I went out, and wandered slowly up the
hill.  The air was soft, and quite warm, and
heavy with the smell of smells, the fragrance
of fresh earth.  Here and there, the paths
were gone, washed clean away, looking like
red skeletons of their former selves, with rock
for bones, all their earthy covering gone.
And here and there, a little off the road, a pale
orchid sheltered beneath a bough, or a dainty
cobra-lily, nestling snug under an overhanging
trunk, peeped with incomparable shy reserve
through some dark vista in the trees.
A mongoose ran across the road, stopped, just
half-way, to stare for an instant at me with
its startled weasel eye, and leaped into cover
on the opposite side.[<a id="chap00bfn2text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn2">2</a>]  In a few minutes I
gained a point of view, and turned to look,&mdash;over
a sea of green, and what a green!
</p>

<p>
For every leaf on every tree was washed
and wet, and glistened as if coated with fresh
paint.  The rich glow of a yellow evening
sun deepened and intensified the wonderful
red colour of patches of naked rock, raw scars
laid bare by little slips of land on places on the
hill.  Cascades of water shot spouting and
splashing into the valleys from innumerable
scarps and shelves along the heights; and as
I listened, I could hear the streams, hidden in
the dense foliage, rushing and gurgling down
the steep slopes, carrying with them as they
went all the loose soil and pebbles they could
find.  And all along the ridges of the hills, to
right and left, on Elphinstone and Lodwick
points, hung brooding enormous masses of
white cloud, the purest, the strangest, the most
indescribably magnificent and beautiful clouds
that I ever saw, whiter than snow, brighter
than polished silver, save only where their
lower edges were charged with heavy rain,
fleeces of colossal milk-white rams, dipped by
the master painter, Deity, in giant vats of
purple ink.  Down and away below them the
staircase of the Ghauts, long lines of broken
hill, were stepping away into the plain, with
every distant detail sharp and clear, cut as it
were in copper, till all merged in the far
horizon, on which a <i>blink</i> of burnished gold
flashed back from the unseen sea, lying right
in the eye of the setting sun.  I listened, and
in the silence, broken only by the ruckle of
the rushing water, somewhere away upon the
hill, I heard a cock crow.  And at that
moment, right above me, I looked and saw: a
mass of shining cloud swung slowly open, and
through the gap, in the deep abyss of heaven,
appeared a spot, a panel, a little lozenge, of
blue: pure, unsullied, silent, elemental, Indian
blue.
</p>

<p>
There, there, was the unearthly colour, the
colour of the mystic lotus, and the long-eyed
languishing Indian Gods.  I knew in that
instant what Kalidas meant, when he compared
the virtue of the just to a patch of heaven
fallen down to earth, the blue celestial leaven
in this world of frenzied storm and weeping
rain.  There was the azure paradox, the blue
that is all but black, dark, transparent, clear
as crystal, shut out from eyes that live in
plains by earth's encircling fog.  But <i>over
every mountain is peace</i>, and the kosmic blue.

<i>To the pitchy dark of that awful wood,[<a id="chap0101fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn1">1</a>]
where plunging Ganges lost her way through
a night of a thousand years: when the lonely
Moon turned ashy pale, mocked by a million
moons that danced in the hollows of the
rushing waves: we bow.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the edge of the great southern forest,
there lived, a thousand years ago, an aged
King and Queen, who counted all the world as
grass, for want of a son and heir.  And finding
all other methods fruitless, in the end they
gave themselves wholly up to meditating,
night and day, on the sole of the Great God's
foot: until at last Maheshwara felt pity for
that childless couple, and revealed himself to
them both at once, in a double dream.  So
when he asked them what they wanted, the
King asked simply for a son.  But the Queen,
being smitten with deep devotion at the sight
of the Great God's moonlit hair, exclaimed:
O Boon Giver, let my son resemble thee, were
it only in a single fraction of an atom of his
being.  Touch me now with the very end of
one of thy tangled locks of hair, and so shall
I become instinct with a tiny portion of thy
divinity.  Then said Shiwa to himself: Even
a single jot of me will be much too powerful
for the rest of this human being's substance,
and disturb the balance of the whole.  But be
it as this mother wills.  For she has made her
choice, and I granted the boon beforehand.[<a id="chap0101fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn2">2</a>]
And I can see that he has to dree the weird[<a id="chap0101fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn3">3</a>]
of his former births.
</p>

<p>
Then he took from his head a single hair, and
broke it off, and placed it in her hand.  And
then he disappeared, and that royal pair
awoke, and eagerly compared their dreams,
which corresponded in every particular.  And
when they looked, lo! shut fast in the hand of
the Queen was a single hair, that glowed like
a wire of flame.[<a id="chap0101fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
Then full of joy, they worshipped the God:
and they placed that hair in a golden shrine,
and built around it a temple.  And when in
course of time the Queen gave birth to a son,
they called him by a suitable name,
Rudrálaka.[<a id="chap0101fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn5">5</a>]  And as the baby became a child, he
did not belie his name.  For his thick dark
hair was shot with a tinge of gleaming red,
and in the sun it shone like fire, and it
resembled the mane of a horse.  And as the boy
became a man, his strength became prodigious;
and his passions were wild and furious
and proportioned to his strength.  And he
was as unruly and unmanageable as a young
colt of high spirit, and so full of wayward
obstinacy and headstrong self-will, that his
father said in private to his mother: Now, but
that the hair in thy hand was red, this son of
thine would seem to take after, not the Great
God himself, but his bull.[<a id="chap0101fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
And when his manhood was complete, like a
river in flood in the rainy season, it overflowed
all common bounds.  And he ran wild among
men and women, overcoming all the men in
every feat of strength and agility, and like
a great black bee in a flower garden, rifling all
the women of their honey and their hearts and
their good behaviour, and playing havoc
among them, till the mischief created by his
own red hair began, as it were, to turn that of
his father and mother white.  Then they said:
Come, we will marry him, and then no doubt
he will settle down and become clear, like
strong wine after fermentation, and turn into
a pillar of his family and the state.  But as
soon as they proposed it, Rudrálaka laughed
in their faces.  And he exclaimed: Who
carries a flower, when it is faded, and what are
women but flowers, fit only to be gathered,
in the moment of their bloom, and worn for
an hour and thrown away?  And he is wise,
who knows how to get from the bee its honey,
and yet elude its sting.  Now a maiden is
all honey, but a wife is a buzzing sting.
Moreover, women are like mountains, and like
snakes, and fire, and the mirage, beautiful in
the distance, and the further off, the better:
and like them, rugged, and biting, and
burning, and luring to destruction all who come
too near.  But of all things this is worst, that
every woman wishes, like a king, to reign
alone, and is utterly unable to endure the very
name of rival, even in her dreams: so that every
husband has in his wife, either a despotic
tyrant, or an exasperated foe, whom nothing can
appease or soothe but absolute submission.
And thus his life is sapped and sucked and
drawn into the being of his wife, till it wholly
disappears, like that of a noble tree, embraced
and treacherously kissed into a premature
decay by a beautiful and clinging creeper.  And
no matter how glorious the flower, I will not
be the tree: nor would I buy a wife, were she
ten thousand times more beautiful than
Rádhá, by the slavery even of a single day.
And what is the need to pay so dear for things
that are always ready to give themselves away
for nothing, and would rather give themselves
away than be bought at any price?  For
women are always longing to give themselves
away, and care only for men that they do not
know: being forgetful of all kindness, and
unbound by obligation, and seeing in their
husband nothing but his faults; while every
passing stranger has their heart, as soon as
he appears, just as long as he is strange.  For
Love is himself a stranger, and cannot
become familiar without ceasing to be Love:
and women live for Love alone, being, like
flowers, nothing but his instruments: and he
is like the amber, and they are like the grass.
</p>

<p>
So when they found that, in spite of all
that they could say, he would not be
persuaded, but that the more they tried, the
harder grew his obstinacy, his parents gave it
up.  And soon afterwards, their hearts broke
with grief, and they died, leaving him
unmarried, and fearing for him, and the kingdom,
and their ancestors, and themselves, lest all
should go to ruin by reason of the incorrigible
perversity of this cutter of their race's stalk.[<a id="chap0101fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
And then, just as though he had only
waited for their death, no sooner had his two
parents gone away on the great road, than
this marriage-hating son of theirs went
hunting in the forest.  And he rode a horse of
spirit like his own, which after a while broke
from control and fled at full speed, carrying
him in an instant out of sight of all his
attendants.  And it brought him, deep in the
heart of the wood, to his destiny, in the form
of a woman, the daughter of an old ascetic,
whose beauty, like a deadly snake, bit and
slew, in a single moment, his antipathy to the
state of marriage, by the poison of its childlike
charm.  And utterly beside himself, he wooed
her then and there, and brought her home
on his own horse, and made her his wife and
Queen.  And she changed him so completely,
that he to whom a wife was slavery, became a
woman's willing slave: so much so, that he
could not bear to let her out of his sight even
for a single instant.  And he became, like an
image of Arddhanári,[<a id="chap0101fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn8">8</a>] inseparable from his
wife, holding her in his arms night and day,
and chafing, like a wild animal kept without
food in a cage, if she left him only to drink
water.  And the God of the flowery bow
laughed, to see his infatuation; and he said
softly to himself: A converted scoffer is, after
all, the best adorer: for even a very clever swan
would fail to separate this milk-and-water.[<a id="chap0101fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0101fn9">9</a>]
But the King's subjects were overjoyed; and
they said: Now, then, his parents will be
happy.  And if his passion is so violent, that
at present he utterly neglects his kingly
duties, no matter.  For when it has become cool,
he will be the very crest-jewel of his race.
</p>

<p>
And then, while he was entirely bewitched
and enthralled by his passion for his new
young moon of a bride, some neighbouring
kings, his hereditary enemies, hearing of his
condition, and seizing their opportunity,
combined together, and attacked him.  And after
a while, his subjects on the frontier, being
ruined, paid no taxes.  So driven by necessity,
he said to his wife, with a sigh: There is no
help for it, and now I must absolutely leave
thee for a little while, to pull these thorns up
by the roots: for if not, the kingdom will be
destroyed.  Yet only for a very little while:
for I will return almost before I have started.
And collecting his army, he put himself at its
head, and threw himself upon those kings,
and scattered them like leaves in a storm of
wind, and reduced them to beg for mercy: for
he was beside himself with rage, seeing in
them not so much enemies of his kingdom as
causes of his unwilling separation from his
wife.  And having speedily gained his object,
he sent relays of horses, and posted them at
intervals all the way from his camp to his
capital.  And then at last, one morning, he
mounted a horse, and started with but one
attendant, and a heart on fire, to return to his wife.
</p>

<p>
So they rode, all day long, at full speed:
stopping only as long as was necessary to let
them leap from one horse to another, as if
wishing to rival the sun in his course; till that
unhappy companion of the King was almost
dead from fatigue, for he was not supported
like his master by the burning desire to arrive.
But the King rode on as it were in a dream,
seeing nothing before him but the edge of the
far horizon, and the image of his wife beyond.
And so the day went by, and as the sun was
going down, they drew near to the capital, and
saw its walls before them, away on the distant
plain.  And the King uttered a shout, and
he drove his spurs deep into the flanks of his
flying horse, and left his follower far behind.
And he rode into the city like a whirlwind, and
dashed through its streets, scattering the
people, and spurning them as it were from his
horse's hoofs.  And he reached his palace, and
rode through the gates into the court, and
threw himself to the ground.  And he stood
on the palace steps, and called aloud with a
joyous voice: Ho! go quickly, and tell the
Queen that the King has come, and waits only
for her permission, to kneel at her lotus-feet.
</p>

<p>
Then the guards, who stood around, gazed
at the King and at each other, in silence and
dismay.  And as they waited, there came to
the King an old chamberlain, who stood before
him with joined hands, and stooping; and his
face was grey with fear.  And he said, with
a shaking voice: Let the King show mercy.
Has he not met the couriers?  The Queen died
of a burning fever, only three days ago.
</p>

<p>
And the King fell to the earth, as though
one had struck him on the head with an iron
club.

And they took him up, and carried him in,
and laid him on a bed.  And there he
remained, like a dead man, and for so long, that
they begun to doubt whether he were not dead
indeed.  But at last, the physicians by their
remedies brought him back to the body.  But
his reason had fled.  For he raved and fought,
struggling with the strength of a giant, and
biting like a wild beast, tearing his own hair,
and shouting for his wife.  And he threw
himself upon his attendants, and handled them so
that they feared for their lives: and he ran
through the palace hunting for his wife, and
calling her by name.  And when he could
not find her, he fell on all whom he met,
and beat them, and came so near to
killing many, that at last his ministers
took counsel, and caused him to be bound.
So after raging for many days, taking
neither food nor drink, he fell into a burning
fever, as if he wished to follow his wife by
the very road she went herself; and he lay for
many weeks on the very threshold of the door
of death.  But his strength was such that he
could not die.  And so, after a long while, he
came back, very slowly, and as it were against
his will, to life and to himself: and little by
little recovered health, and took once more to
his kingly duties, and the bearing of the
burden of the state.  But it was, as if his better
part had died, refusing to be parted from his
wife, in the other world, and leaving behind
in this only so much of his soul as was
necessary to enable him to live at all.  For he
never moved from his palace, roaming about
its rooms, always silent, and always alone, with
his head sunk down upon his breast, and his
sad eyes fixed upon the ground: and over his
dark face there never passed the whiteness of a
smile: for his dead wife's shadow lay across it,
and her figure moved before him night and
day; and her sweetness, not to be forgotten,
and never to return, rankled in his heart like
a thorn, and goaded it, and gnawed it, and
festered in his soul: and sleep forsook his eyes,
which were wild, and haggard, and such that
all who saw them feared him, and were wary
in his presence: for every now and then he
broke out into paroxysms of grief mixed with
laughter, during which he seemed, as it were,
not to know what he was doing, and was as
dangerous to approach as a wild mother
elephant robbed by hunters of her calf.  And so
he lived, and months went by, and the grey
hairs came before their time and settled in his
head, and sowed as it were its fire with the
ashes of grey grief: and age saw her
opportunity, and began unheeded and unhindered
to furrow wrinkles in his brow, and dig deep
corners at the ends of his stern shut lips.

</p>

<p>
Now it happened, on a day, when the Great
God was roaming through the sky with Umá
in his arms, that they passed close by the moon.
And suddenly, they heard in the stillness a
mournful voice, like the note of a <i>chakrawákí</i>
bewailing her lost mate, exclaiming at
intervals: Alas! alas!  So they stopped and
alighted on the surface of the cold-rayed orb,
and wandered about in his camphored air,
guided by the sound, till they came all at once
upon a Siddhá.[<a id="chap0103fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0103fn1">1</a>]  And she was sitting under
a sandal tree, leaning her head against the
trunk, with large tears in her great blue eyes,
and a cloud of dark dishevelled hair floating
about her bare white bosom, whose two colossal
pearls rose and fell, heaving and fretting
as if regretting their absent ocean home.  Then
filled with compassion and curiosity, Umá
exclaimed: What can be the meaning of this
sighing Siddhá?  And Maheshwara divined
the truth.  But he said: Ask her.  Thereupon
Párwatí said: O thou lotus lady, what is thy
trouble?  And the Siddhá said: O Daughter
of the Mountain, I have attained, by superfluity
of merit, to this position of a Siddhá,
which notwithstanding is only a grief and no
pleasure to me.  For I remember my former
birth, and I can see my husband, sorrowing
for my absence away below.  And now I
would give all that remains of my unexhausted
stock of accumulated merit for a single
moment of the time that is past, did it last no
longer than the twinkling of an eye.  For
what is the use of my Siddháhood, or anything
else, without my lord?  Or why am I cursed
with reminiscence, and not rather rewarded
with oblivion?  For memory binds my soul,
and links it like a red hot chain to the burning
fire of a dead delight.
</p>

<p>
Then Párwatí said in private to the God:
Canst thou not do something for this lovely
Siddhá?  And Maheshwara replied: This is
the nature of women, that for the sake of their
single lover, they would annihilate the three
worlds.  But what has pity to do with the
constitution of the universe?  Or how can
time return again, and all be thrown into
confusion, simply to allow two foolish lovers to
meet once more?  So there is nothing
whatever to be done.  But Párwatí coaxed him
and cajoled him, knowing the power of her two
white arms, until at last he said: Since I can
refuse thee nothing, and thou art absolutely
set upon it, I will, to please thee, cause these
two unhappy persons to re-enact their little
drama, and taste again the nectar of that love
which they so much regret: but only in a
dream.  For dreams were established by the
Creator for this very reason, that a remedy
might be found for the irrevocable nature of
reality.  For that must be as it has been, and
cannot be recalled or changed: but anything
may happen in a dream.  And yet, this pair
of lovers would be wiser, were they content to
let alone, and leave things as they are.  For
they will but make their misery more, by the
very means they wish to take to lessen and
remove it.  But be that as it may.
</p>

<p>
And then, he cast upon the Siddhá a kindly
glance.  And he said: Silly child, that wouldst
be wiser than those who framed the three
great worlds, be now consoled.  Thou shalt,
at least, have thy way, for a little while, and
meet the lord of thy heart again, halfway
between heaven and earth.
</p>

<p>
And hearing this, the Siddhá fell before
him, and took his foot, and kissed it, and
placed it in her bosom.  And she said: O
saviour of the shipwrecked that are sinking in
the waves of time, O send me thy succour soon,
for I am like one dying of thirst in the desert
for the blue water of my husband's arms.

IV
</p>

<p>
And at that very moment, the King her husband
on the earth was sitting in his palace hall,
musing on her memory, and dreaming of the
past, and listening to the musicians, playing
before him as he sat.  So as they played, as
luck would have it, they fell upon an air, which
ran into his heart, and pierced it like a
poisoned needle: for it was the favourite air of his
vanished Queen.  And as he listened, the tears
came rushing into his eyes, blinding them with
love-longing and the blackness of despair.
And he started up, and called aloud, in a voice
of thunder: Away! begone!  Wretches, have ye
conspired together to break my heart in two?
And instantly, those unlucky players stopped
affrighted, and fled before his wrath like hares.
And as all shrank before him, the domestic
chaplain came forward, and said politely: O
King, without are waiting certain merchants,
jewellers, who have come here by appointment,
to lay their jewels at thy feet.
</p>

<p>
Then the King said, with a sigh: What are
all their gems to me?  And yet, no matter: let
them all come in.
</p>

<p>
So in came all the merchants, and showed
the King each what he had.  And the King
went up and down, saying sadly to himself:
Now every pleasure is a pain, and every joy,
a grief.  For what are jewels to me, now that
she is no more, on whom I would have hung
them till she sank beneath their weight?  And
then, as if in irony, he took the jewels and
began to put them on himself.  And taking
from the merchants all they had, he hung
himself all over, loading himself with gorgeous
gems, with emeralds and rubies, and pearls and
amethysts and diamonds, and sapphires, and
every other stone, till he flashed as it were with
a thousand hues, and resembled an incarnation
of the spoiling of the sea.
</p>

<p>
So as he went from one merchant to another,
adding to his store, he came suddenly
on an old merchant, who stood a little apart
from the rest, with nothing visible to sell.  And
his head was of enormous size, and bare,[<a id="chap0104fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0104fn1">1</a>] and
bald on the top, and from its sides long thick
white hair ran down over his shoulders, and
mingled with his beard.  And his face was
wrinkled all over, like the skin of a withered
fruit.  And the King stopped and considered
him, amazed at the extraordinary size of his
head, which resembled a monstrous gourd.
And then he said: Ha! merchant: thou art
idle.  Where are thy valuables, and what is
thy commodity?  Doubtless that must be a
treasure, which thou keepest wrapped away so
carefully from common eyes.  But come,
produce it: that I may add it to all these.  Then
said the merchant: All these are well enough:
and yet, the thing that I have brought the
King is more than all together, and yet
again, less than the least.  Then the King
said: Of what, then, art thou a seller?  And
the merchant said: O King, I am a seller of
dreams.
</p>

<p>
And the King looked at him awhile, and was
seized with sudden laughter.  And he
exclaimed: What is this, and who ever heard of
a seller of dreams?  Art thou mad, or art thou
only an old buffoon?  Then that old merchant
fixed his eyes upon the King.  And he said:
</p>

<p>
O King, who can tell, whether he is mad or
not?  But as for me, know, that mine are no
common dreams, but they are such as many
would give all they had, and more than all
they had, to dream.  For I can make the past
present, and I can find that which is lost, and
join together whom time has parted, and turn
regret to laughing joy: and I can mend the
broken-hearted, and bring love's fierce
emotion back, and into faded flowers of passion
I can breathe again their old sweet bloom, and
make to echo in living ears the music of lips
that have long been dead.
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke, the King stood, and his
heart rose up into his mouth.  For the words
of the old merchant played on it, as if it were
a lute, and tugged at it like a cord; and the
memory of his wife surged suddenly in his
soul, and swept it like a wind.  And all at
once, he seized that old man by the throat,
with hands that trembled with the ecstasy of
rage, and shook him like a leaf.  And his voice
faltered with passion, as he said: Old fool, dost
thou mock me?  Dost thou promise, without
performing?  Beware! for thou art playing
with a fire that will shrivel thee like a blade of
grass.
</p>

<p>
Then said the old merchant, with laughter
in his wrinkled eyes: O King, thou art a child,
not recognising thy physician, and seeking a
quarrel with the only one who can give thee a
medicine suited to thy case.  For I am a
physician, not of the body, but of the soul.  So
now, tell me: wilt thou buy from me a dream,
or not?  And the King looked at him for a
moment; and he drew a long breath, and the
tears stood in his eyes.  And he said: Sell me
indeed a dream, such as I wish, and thou hast
described, and I tell thee this, that I will not
haggle with thee over the price.  Then the old
man laughed softly, and he said: Maháráj, who
ever speaks of the price, before he has seen and
tried the goods?  First, thou shalt have thy
dream; and as to the price, we will leave it:
and thou thyself shalt name it, at the end.
For maybe, didst thou know the price, thou
wouldst hesitate to buy at all.
</p>

<p>
Then he put his hand into his breast, and
drew out a little flask.  And he held that little
crystal flask up in the air, looking for a ray
of light.  And when he could not find one,
that old man muttered under his breath: Sun,
sun, send me a ray.  And at that very
moment, there shot into the room a ray of light,
right on the little flask.  And then that old
man said: O King, see! this is a little of the
very essence of the nectar of the cold-rayed
moon, where I have been this morning, to
fetch it from that lord of herbs.  And the
King looked, and lo! there danced in that little
flask a liquor that laughed and bubbled, and
its deep blue was exactly the same as the
colour of his dead wife's eyes.  And like them,
it smiled at him, changing from hue to hue,
till it seemed to him that those very eyes were
looking straight into his own, out of the little
flask.  And quickly he put out his hand, and
snatched it, and took the stopper from its
mouth.  And there came from it a perfume
that carried to his nostrils the scent of his
dead wife's hair.  And his brain reeled, and
he put it hastily to his lips, to drink.  And as
he did so, suddenly there came into his head
a thought.  And he paused in the very act,
looking at that old merchant, out of the corner
of his eye.  And he said to himself: Ha!  What
if this old seeming merchant were an emissary
of those foes of mine, whom I defeated, to give
me a deadly draught?  Or even so, what
matter?  Let me drink quickly, the more poisonous,
the better.  For life without her will not
be worse, even when turned to death.
</p>

<p>
And then, at a single gulp, he drank the
contents of the flask.  And instantly, he sank
back, and lay on the cushions on which he fell,
buried in a magic sleep.
</p>

<p>
But as soon as he saw that the King slept,
that old merchant stooped down, and squatted
quickly on the floor, with his two hands
grounded between his feet, and his knees
reaching to his ears.  And there he remained,
with closed eyes, couched in the pitcher
posture like a lonely, water-watching crane, and
still, as if he had been painted on the wall.

But the King's soul rose out of his body,
like a snake escaping from its slough.  And
he hovered for only a single instant, over that
empty shell of him, lying, loaded with
priceless gems, on the floor below, and then shot
up into the blue sky, like a flame parted from
its wick.  And as he flew like a thought
through space, going like the wind he knew
not where, the King said to himself: Ha! so
then, I was not deceived.  Certainly, that old
impostor was not a merchant, but a secret
agent of my foes, and now I am dead, beyond
a doubt.  And that delicious poison was as
speedy as it was beautiful and sweet.  And
now I can say farewell to life without regret.
And yet I should like to know, where in the
world I can be going.
</p>

<p>
So as he floated in the air, bathed in
unutterable peace, there came over his mounting
soul a feeling of supreme disdain and loathing
for his body that was lying down below.  And
he said to himself, as he closed his eyes:
Ah! joy, for I have left behind that wretched
sheath, with all its poor surroundings and its
miserable mundane ties.  I have emerged, as
it were, from a charnel ground, and surely that
divine liquor was, as that old vendor said, a
very potent essence of nectar and celestial
wine, mixed of the icy camphor and the oozy
juices of the moon.[<a id="chap0201fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn1">1</a>]  For I feel like one
intoxicated, and I swim, as it were, in perfume,
whose pungent and excessive sweetness
almost robs me of my giddied sense; and I lie
on the azure ether as if on a silken couch,
poised as it were between earth and heaven,
and yet I seem to soar like some earth-despising
spirit-roamer in the sky.
</p>

<p>
Then after a while, he opened his eyes, and
looked round, and saw himself alone in the
vault of space, surrounded by the stars.  And
he was rushing like a comet[<a id="chap0201fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn2">2</a>] through the
mansions of the moon, and he saw Chitrá, and
Swáti, and Rohini and the Hunter,[<a id="chap0201fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn3">3</a>] and the
rest, and far in the north, the polar star.  And
he looked down on the Seven Rishis,[<a id="chap0201fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn4">4</a>] and saw,
far below him, the icy summits of the Snowy
Mountain, with the yellow digit of the moon
clinging to the peak of Kailas, like the earth
of old on the horn of the holy Boar.[<a id="chap0201fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
And then suddenly, memory pierced him
like a needle.  And he cried out: Alas!  I am
still alone, and in this respect, even death has
brought no change.  And what then is the
use of death, if it does not restore me to my
wife?  And what is the use of this rushing
speed?  For I am hurrying, against my will,
into the very zenith of infinite space.
</p>

<p>
And even as he spoke, he stopped, and
hung in the air like a fleck of cloud.  And
strange! as if the very thought had produced
her, suddenly he found his wife in his arms.
And as her own arms glided around his neck,
and her bosom beat against his own, his hair
stood on end with amazement and delight.
And he heard the beating of his own heart,
throbbing like thunder through the realms of
space.  And just as he was going to speak,
she stopped his mouth by kissing him with
soft lips opening into a smile, and eyes that
reflected the colour of the sky.  And she said:
Quick, let us lose no time.  Then he said:
Ah! couldst thou die, leaving me without thee
in that hell below?  Then she said again:
How can mortals disobey, when destiny
decrees?  It was from necessity that I left thee,
and not from choice.  But let us quickly make
the most of a little time, granted only by the
favour of the God who has the moon in his
hair, and destined to end and disappear almost
as soon as it has begun.  Dost thou remember
how we met, and saw each other first of all,
away in the wood below?  Come back now
once more with me, and let us live and love
again, and taste the nectar of repetition,
before we part to meet no more.
</p>

<p>
And instantly the King lost his senses, and
lay in a dream within a dream.  And as they
floated in each other's arms, between the
heaven and the earth, the past rose up out of
the dark, before him, spread like a picture
before his eyes and breathed like a tale into his
ear.

SPRUNG FROM THE MUD
</p>

<p>
And once again, he rode through the forest
at headlong speed, and the trees flew by him
like frightened shadows, while his horse ran
on, and carried him swiftly whither it would,
into the forest depths.  And then at last, it
stopped short, on the very edge of a great
river, close to an aged banyan tree, whose
hanging roots dropped from the branches to
the ground, and with their network almost hid
a little ruined shrine, whose roof their pillars
pierced and split, and whose steps ran down
into the stream beneath their sacred shade,
where the quiet water was littered thick with
lotus flowers and floating withered leaves.
And there he fell from his horse's back and
threw himself upon the ground: and he and
his horse together slaked their intolerable
thirst, with neither eyes nor ears for aught,
till they had drunk their fill.  And then, with a
wisp of leaves and grass, he began to wipe the
foam and sweat from the quivering limbs of
that noble horse, dearer to him, till that very
moment, than anything else on earth.
</p>

<p>
So as he stood, wholly intent on his horse
and his work, he heard behind him a little
rustle, and a low cry.  And he looked round.
And in that instant, like a flash of lightning,
he utterly forgot his horse, and himself, and
everything else in the three worlds.
</p>

<p>
For there, standing a little way off, under
that old root-dropping fig, was one who
resembled the guardian spirit of that virgin
forest's enchanted beauty, caught in the very
act of changing into a feminine form, and
leaving him in doubt as he gazed, whether she
was a woman or a tree, or a being mixed of
both.  For the coarse red bark that clothed
her left bare her arms and feet, which were
shaped like those of Hari's darling,[<a id="chap0202fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn1">1</a>] and it
cased and swathed her soft round limbs,
allowing them to escape, like the calyx of a new
young flower, or a rough hard husk on the
very point of bursting open, by reason of the
ripeness of the tempting fruit of womanhood,
hardly to be held within.  And a spray of
blue convolvulus[<a id="chap0202fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn2">2</a>] hung twining all about her,
trailing like a creeper from her hair, which was
twisted up into a great dark knot on the very
top of her pretty head, and hung there like a
purple bank of thunder-cloud, out of whose
shadow her great blue eyes looked round as
the moon with wonder at the thing they saw
before them.  And her chin was very pointed,
shaped like a <i>pippal</i> leaf, and over it the
mind-born god had set the seal of his bow in her
face, black in the twin-arch of her brow, and
red in her juicy <i>bimbá</i> lips.  And astonishment
flushed her cheeks, like fruits, with a spot
of damask blush, like bloom.  And a single
lotus, red as blood, nestled in the little hollow
dip between the mounds of her rising breasts,
upland hills where the robber Love lay lurking,
to spoil the traveller of his heart.  And
the sweeping curve of her heavy hips stole the
eyes of the King away from her slender
clasp-inviting waist, till it came to an end in the
nook of her inward-bending knee.  And her
left hand rested gently on a pillar of the tree,
while her right was stretched before her,
bending back, palm upwards, with all its fingers
spread, till the tip of its forefinger just touched
her lower lip.  And Love fished for the
King's soul with her lovely wrist and arm, and
took it in their net.  And she was standing
bolt upright, poised like a flower on her left
foot's toes, with her right foot just behind it,
exactly like a graceful fawn suddenly frozen
into stone when running at its utmost speed
by the sight of danger in its path.  For she
stood absolutely still, save that the lotus on
her breast was lifted quickly up and down by
the flutter of the maiden-wave on which it swam.
</p>

<p>
So they two stood, still as death, each
thunderstruck by the other's vision, like a
panther and its prey.[<a id="chap0202fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn3">3</a>]  And then at last, after
a time that seemed to each in spite of its
length but a single instant, for each was lost
in the other, standing on the threshold of
Love's dream-bower where years are moments
and time lies dead, she spoke, and broke the
spell.  And she said, softly: It is a man.
Surely, thou art a man?  And the King said,
with a smile: O maid, what else?  Then she
said again: And thy companion, what is he?
And the King said: He is a horse.  Then she
clapped her hands together, and exclaimed,
as she held them joined: Ah! stand still a
little longer, and let me watch both him and thee.
For I have never seen before, either a horse or
a man.  So he stood still as she desired; and
as she watched him, he watched her.  And her
blue eyes rested on him, and entered into his
soul, and shook it so, that he began to tremble
all over with the horror of extreme delight.
And he said to himself: I too, I too, see a
woman, for the very first time in all my life;
which, till this very moment, has been wasted
and empty and worthless, and contemptible
and without a point.  Ha!  I am like a dark
black night, that has suddenly been flooded
with the rapture of a golden sun.  O hail!  O
bright great God, in the form of that
blue-eyed beautiful thing before me, that fills me
with astonishment and laughter and supreme
delight.  And presently he said: O thou with
the blue flowers in thy hair and the blue
wonder in thy enormous eyes, that resemble those
of a child, how can it be that in a world so
full of them, thou shouldst never yet have set
those eyes on either a man or a horse?
</p>

<p>
Then she started as if from a dream.  And
she came up close to him, and raised her hand,
as though she would touch his arm: and barely
touched it, with a touch like that of a leaf,
which struck the King like a heavy blow.  And
she said, looking up at him, doubtfully: But
O thou great, beautiful, deep-voiced man, how
should I see either?  For out of this wood I
never was, and into it nothing ever comes, and
in it are only its own trees, with the flowers,
and the river, and the forest beasts, and my
father and myself.  Then the King said: Thy
father?  And is not he a man?  And she
said: Nay, if thou art, he is not.  For he is
old, very old, and smaller even than myself,
and his hair and beard are thin and white, and
his arms and legs are rough as bark, and dry
and thin as sticks.  And he sits always stiff
and silent, plunged in meditation, resembling
the stump of an ancient tree: and it is the same
as if he were not alive.[<a id="chap0202fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn4">4</a>]  And if thou wilt, I
will show him to thee, a little way within the
wood: and yet, it were better not, for it would
but distract his meditation.  But thou art tall
and straight and strong, and glorious, and
young like me: and yet far bigger than myself! for
see! how even on tiptoe I reach hardly
to thy shoulder.  And thy hair is like the lion's
mane, and thou art like him to look at, and
wonderful in every way, and such as I could
never have believed.  For often I have thought
of men, and wondered what they could be like,
but never dreamed of one like thee.  Look
only at my hand, and thine, or at my arm, or
foot, and thine, and see how small and weak[<a id="chap0202fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn5">5</a>] a
thing I am, compared with thee!
</p>

<p>
And the King looked at her, as she spoke;
and when she ended, he began to laugh for
very joy.  And he said: O beautiful little
blue-eyed creature, thou dost not know thy own
strength, nor where it lies, but how as to thy
mother?  Hadst thou, indeed, a mother, or
didst thou not rather grow, like a flower, out
of some forest tree?  Then she said: Nay, I
had a mother: but alas! long ago she went
away, before I can remember.  For she was a
heavenly Apsaras, whom Indra sent down
here below, to tempt my father in this wood,
and turn him from his penance.[<a id="chap0202fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0202fn6">6</a>]  And she
came and stayed with him awhile, and
afterwards she went away, flying up to heaven,
and leaving me behind her with my father in
the wood.  And the King said: I do not
blame thy father: what wonder, indeed, if she
overcame his resolution, did she resemble her
future daughter, even a very little?  And thy
words require no other witness to their truth,
except thyself.  For beyond a doubt thou art
the very daughter of an Apsaras.  Then she
said: And hast thou ever seen an Apsaras?
And the King laughed, and he said: Nay, not
until this moment.  But come now, let me
only tether my horse to yonder tree, and then,
if thou wilt, we will sit and talk together.
And I will be thy playfellow, and will tell thee
things that thou dost not know, and thou shall
tell me of nothing but thyself.
</p>

<p>
Then she said joyfully: Ah! tie him, and
come quickly.  And the King stood looking
at her for a moment, and then he said: Sweet
Blue-eyes, and art thou not afraid of me?
And she looked at him enquiringly, with no
shadow of suspicion, and said: Of what should
I be afraid?  For art thou not a man, and
which of the Creator's creatures injures its
own kind?  And the King gazed into her soul,
through the window of her clear and smiling
eyes, and again he laughed aloud for sheer
delight.  And he said to himself: Ha! exquisite
is her intoxicating simplicity, in that she does
not know, that man alone is the exception to
her rule.  And then he said: Sweet forest
flower, what if I were tempted to pluck thee,
and carry thee away with me on my horse?
And yet, fear nothing: for thou art very right,
and I am, of all the Creator's creatures, the
one who would be most loth to do thee harm.
And men were made strong by the Creator
for this very reason, to guard such wonderful
weak things as thee.  And he said to himself:
Now, let my followers only not find me till
the evening, and by the favour of the Deity, I
will win the trust of this bewitching maiden,
and get her to come away with me.  Or if not,
I will stay in the wood with her for ever,
becoming for her sake like one of these forest
trees, rooted to the spot.
</p>

<p>
And then he took his horse, and tied him to
the tree.  And then they went together and
sat down upon the moss-grown steps that ran
down into the river: he on one, and she on
another, just below.

PURUSHA AND PRAKRITI

<p>
And then, for a little while, he sat in silence,
looking now at the river, and now at her.  But
she gazed at him with great eyes that never
left him for a moment, and saw nothing but
himself.  And suddenly he said to her:
Blue-eyes, Blue-eyes, how long is it, since I met
thee in the wood?  Then she said: It is but a
single moment.  Then he said: Thou art
utterly mistaken: it is more than many thousand
years.  And as she looked at him in wonder,
he exclaimed: Ha! there it is again, and O
how beautiful thou art!  O thine eyes are full
of wonder and my soul is full of joy.  Dear
child, see, yonder is the river, flowing as it has
been flowing ever since it first began; and here
am I, to thee the first and only man, for thou
hast never seen another, and there art thou,
for me the only woman, and her very type
and soul.  And like the ancient Soul of Man,[<a id="chap0203fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn1">1</a>]
I have been wandering about, forlorn and
wretched and lonely in the dark without thee,
and now at last I have found in thee my Prakriti,
since thou art the very spirit of the beauty
of this wood, incarnate in a woman's lovely
form.  And as I look at thee, laughter seems
to fill my soul, for joy that I have found thee,
and I feel as if, like thee, I had suddenly
become a child, whereas before I was a man.
And all this has come about in the moment
since we met, a moment which is like a door,
opening on one life, and closing on another,
and it resembles the beginning and the end.
</p>

<p>
Then she said: I do not understand thee:
yet speak on, without stopping: for I could
look at thee and listen to thy voice, for ever.
And the King said: Blue-eyes, if thou dost
not understand, no matter: and possibly I am
speaking at random words without a meaning,
for thy great eyes deprive me of my reason,
and I know not very well what I say.  But
now it is thy turn.  And tell me, what dost
thou do with thyself alone in this empty wood?
Hast thou companions other than myself?
Then she said: I have for companions the deer
of the forest, and the parrots that live in this
great tree, and the peacock that thou seest
yonder on the temple wall, and the crows that
come to eat the daily offering, and the flowers
which I water and wear woven in my hair.
And I have many things to do.  For
sometimes I ramble in the wood, and hunt for
flowers, and watch the monkeys and the
squirrels that play in the trees: and when I am
tired, I sit still, playing with my hair, and
rolling and unrolling it, for it is longer than I
am myself and a trouble and a hindrance to
me, till I knot it up thus out of the way on the
top of my head, like my father's.[<a id="chap0203fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn2">2</a>]  And
sometimes I go and see my father, but I am afraid
of him, for though his body is there, his soul is
almost always absent from the body.  And
sometimes I sit by the river, when the wind is
still, and watch in its mirror the clouds that
float in the blue sky far below, like the swans
upon its wave.  And the river itself is a
friend to me, for every day I bathe in it, and
I often sit and wonder whence it comes and
where it goes, and look to see what it carries
down: and in the rainy season it changes, and
grows red and angry, and murmurs and
chafes, and swells till it reaches to the very
foot of the tree.  And sometimes when the
moon is full, I hide in the hollow trees at night;,
and peep out at the elephants as they wander
down to drink.  And the King said: But do
the other animals not molest thee?  Then she
said: Nay, for they dare not: for they all
know my father well, who understands their
language, and has warned them.  And they
fear him, lest he should curse them if they
harmed me, and keep them from ever rising up
into humanity, being prisoned for ever by the
power of his curse in the dungeon of their
creeping[<a id="chap0203fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn3">3</a>] bodies.  And the King said, with
emphasis: Aye! they who should injure thee
would indeed deserve to be immured for all
eternity in the lowest of all living forms.  And
I thank thy excellent old father for preserving
thee under the shadow of his awful curse.  And
yet, for all this, surely thy life was lonely?
Didst thou never long for a companion of thine
own kind, such a playfellow, for instance, as myself?
</p>

<p>
Then she said: Though I knew it not before,
yet now that thou art come, I see that I was
lonely.  For often I used to watch myself
reflected in the water, and talk to my image, and
wish that it could answer me.  And sometimes
in the moonlight I would play with my
shadow, and wish, oh! so much, that it could
come to life.  And often I used to long, not
knowing what I wanted; but now I am very
sure that it was thou.  And when I look at
thee, and hear thy voice, I cannot understand
how I could have lived without thee.  For
thou art like another self, made visible in a
human form: and yet thou art other, and more
than that first self, which is I.
</p>

<p>
And the King gazed at her, with fire in his
veins.  And he said to himself: She is innocence
itself, in a virgin form of matchless and
incomparable beauty, and speaks without
understanding the meaning of her own words.
For love lies hiding, lurking in her soul, and
yet she does not know it.  And yet, though
she does not, I know well, and only too well,
now, what it is to be in love: for she burns my
heart like a flame, all the more, that she is
utterly unconscious of the power of her own
beauty.  And then he said: Blue-eyes, canst
thou tell me this?  Say, wouldst thou rather
that I were in very truth the double of thyself,
like thy image in the water, a woman, and
not a man?  And she answered, without
hesitation: Nay, it is better as it is.  And the
King trembled with joy.  And he said: Yet
why?  Then she pondered for a while, and
then she said: I cannot tell.  And yet I feel,
that I would rather have thee different from
myself than the same; and yet I know not
why.  But what does it matter, why?  since
it is better as it is.  And the King said with
emotion: Sweet, thou art right.  Aye! it is
far better, and it does not matter why.
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke, there came a murmur, and
a rushing sound in the air.  And he looked up
in terror, and listened, and exclaimed:
Ah! what is that?  Then she said: It is nothing
but the sighing of the wind in the hollows of
the young bamboos.

And the King sighed also, with relief: for
he feared that his followers had found him in
the wood.  And then he said: Blue-eyes, hast
thou a name?  Then she said: I have only the
name which was my mother's.  And the King
said: What was that?  Then she said: Long
ago, when my father first saw my mother in
the wood, she was standing by a bush, which
had just burst into blossom all over, as if by
the touch of her foot.[<a id="chap0204fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn1">1</a>]  And the bees were
humming and bustling eagerly all about it
and her, as if they wished to kiss her,
and my father saw it, and he called her by a
name of his own, that has come by inheritance
also to me.  For my father has never called
me anything else.  And the King said: And
what then was the name?  And she said:
Alichumbitá.[<a id="chap0204fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn2">2</a>]  And the King clapped his hands,
and exclaimed: Certainly, thy father is
admirable, and thy name appropriate.  And sure I
am, that there must be more than the name of
relationship between that happy bush and thee.
And I am tempted to believe that thy story
of an Apsaras was false, and that thou hadst
for a mother no other than the very indwelling
spirit of that sweetly-scented, bee-haunted
bush.  Then she said: Nay, my mother was an
Apsaras.  And the King exclaimed: How
shall I believe thee?  For already I am
beginning to doubt whether thou ever hadst
either mother or father, and wert not rather
directly compounded by the Deity himself in
the form of a bee, going from flower to flower,
and culling thy composition out of every
flower's fragrant essence and every blossom's
painted bloom.  And she said laughing: And
what then was thy composition?  And the King
looked at her joyously, and said: The Deity
was thy creator, and thou art mine.  For I
never lived until this moment, and this is all
thy doing.  Thou hast found me like an empty
shell, and filled me with colour and emotion
and the salt of beauty and the sound of
laughter and the tossing to and fro of the
waves of pleasure and delight.  Now put me
to thy ear, and I shall echo like the sea.  Then
she said: Once more, I do not understand.
And the King said: O ocean, no matter.  But
thy shell must murmur, being full of thee,
whether it will or no.  And yet, this at least
now thou dost surely understand, that I was
right, and that ages have elapsed, since we met
each other a little while ago in the wood.  For
I have utterly forgotten every fragment of my
life that went before, and as I said, I have
begun to live, only since I saw thy face.  And
thou hast discovered that thy life in the wood
was very lonely till I came.  And it is as
though we had both been sleeping, and had
just waked up.  And now we are playfellows,
and I will be King, and thou shall be Queen.
Or hast thou never heard of kings and
queens?  Then she said: Nay, I have heard.
For formerly, before my father became so
utterly devoted to asceticism, he used to tell
me stories.  And in almost every story, there
was a king and queen.  Then the King said:
And if then I were king, wouldst thou come
away with me and be my queen?  And she
laughed, and said: But what sort of queen
should I be, that know nothing of the duties
and behaviour of a queen?
</p>

<p>
Then he said: Sweet little Queen, although
thou dost not know it, thy qualifications for
the post of queen are such that they could not
be surpassed.  And the duties are easy to be
learned, and the pleasures more than thou
couldst dream.  Only come with me, and I
will show thee what they are.  Or if thou
wilt, I will draw thee a picture in the air, and
hold it up before thee, to show thee as in a
mirror thy life as a queen, and give thee a
foretaste of its nectar.  Hast thou never watched
the bubbles on the surface of the stream?
Dost thou not know how every bubble is like
a little heaven, and glows for a moment with
every colour of the sky, and bursts: but the
sky remains?  So is it with my picture.  For
like a bubble, it will burst as soon as painted,
being only words: but the heaven which it
shows thee in its mirror shall be thine, as long
as life endures.
</p>

<p>
Then she said: Draw, then, thy picture, and
let me see thy heaven.  And she settled
herself to listen, leaning her cheek upon her hand,
and looking at the King so sagely that he
shook with agitation, so intense was his desire
to take her in his arms.  And he exclaimed:
Blue eyes, come and be my Queen, and I will
put thee in a palace, and build it for thee
seven stories high, of ebony and sandalwood,
and of silver and of gold.  O come and be my
Queen, and thou shalt walk on pavements more
worthy of thy little feet than this rough
ground, on marble of many colours, and on
floors of precious stones.  Only be my Queen,
and I will strip thee of thy bark, and wrap
thee in silky webs and tissues coloured like
the rainbow, till like the moon behind a filmy
cloud, thy symmetry shall borrow beauty from
tell-tale veils of gossamer and envelopes of
woven gauze.  Ah! come with me and be my
little Queen, and I will load thy neck and arms
with jewels, and thou shall play with heaps of
pearl, and coral, and all the riches of the sea.
Aye, shouldst thou prick thy finger, I will
mend it with a ruby, and shouldst thou drop
a tear, I will redeem it with a diamond, and
try in vain to match, with turquoise or
lapis-lazuli or opal, the colour of thine eyes.
Ah! come, and slaves shall serve my dainty Queen
with food on golden plates, and snow cold
drinks in crystal cups, and when thou wilt,
pour music in thy little ear.  And elephants
shall carry thee about, or thou shall ride on
horses, or float on silent pools starred like the
sky with a multitude of lotuses, or lie on
couches softer than a flower, fanned in the
heat of noon with scented leaves, or listening
at midnight to the moonstones, oozing as they
swing in the window's trellised frames.  Ah!
Blue-eyes, come and be my Queen, for I
cannot do without thee, and all that I have said
is nothing, for it is only the casket for thy
soul.  For I will be there, and serve thee all
day long upon my knees.  Ah!  I will take thy
soul, and steep it in elixir, and drown it in the
perfume and the fragrance of stories and of
dreams, and dye it with the colour strained
from the subtle essences of far-off lakes of
passion and emotion, lying in the distant land
beyond the blue horizon where the earth and
heaven meet.  Aye!  I would turn the three
worlds upside down, only to be near thee, and
watch the shadow of the pleasures I would find
there reflected in thine eyes, O thou naïvest and
most exquisite of queens.
</p>

<p>
And she watched him as he spoke, and when
he stopped, she continued to look at him in
silence.  And then to his amazement, she
dropped her eyes, and the colour rose a very
little in her cheek, that was overshadowed by
her long soft lashes, and she said: Nay, thou
art only laughing at me, knowing my
inexperience.  And as thou saidst, thy words are
only bubbles, beautiful, and bursting as they
jostle one another, and delusive.  Nor is this
the kind of queen that I would be.  And the
King said, with curiosity: And what then, O
maiden difficult to please, is thy conception of
a queen?  And she waited for a moment, and
she said, keeping her eyes fixed upon the
ground: Once my father told me of a queen
very different from thine.  And I cannot tell
thee the story as he told it, for I am not a
<i>pundit</i>, as is he.  But he told me of a king,
who was set upon by enemies and driven from
his throne.  And when all the world
abandoned him, a single friend remained to him,
and that one was his queen: who followed him
in exile, and lived with him in poverty, and
wandered through the world behind him like
his shadow, enjoying never one of the pleasures
thou hast mentioned, but sharing all his
evil fortune, a pleasure infinitely greater than
them all.  And when he died, she would not
stay behind him, but followed him through the
fire, into the other world.

A PAINTED LADY

<p>
And the King listened with amazement, and
when she ended, he looked at her with eyes that
glistened, and a heart that swelled towards her
as she sat with downcast eyes, as if ashamed
of her words, before him on the ground.  And
he struck his hands together, and exclaimed to
himself: Ha! very wonderful is the way of the
Creator, who teaches all his creatures the
law of their behaviour, without the means
of any master.  For this mud-born[<a id="chap0205fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn1">1</a>] pure
white lotus of a maiden has understood
without assistance and as it were by
native instinct, the whole duty of a faithful
wife, even before she has so much as
seen a man.  And then he said: Sweet little
ascetic, apt pupil of a wise old father, whom
thou dost resemble not only in thy hair, thou
hast administered reproof to me, deservedly.
And whereas I thought, in my folly, to
instruct thee, it was I that received a lesson, in
this matter of the way of queens.  And now
I see, that I spoke more truly than I knew,
when I said that thou wert admirably fitted to
be a queen.  Now, therefore, thou art my
<i>guru</i>, and I am thy disciple, and thou shalt
teach me all that I do not know.  Begin then,
my pretty little <i>guru</i>: give me lessons, for I
need them.  And she laughed, and blushed,
and said: Again thou art laughing at me: for
how could a simple forest maiden teach
anything to one, who like thyself, had lived in
cities, and mixed with other men and women?
And the King said quickly: Ah! dear Blue-eyes,
just for that very reason is it that thou
hast already taught me many things that I
never knew before.  For they who live in
cities have their souls tainted as it were and
poisoned by bad associations, whereas thine
is as pure as the flowers in thy hair.  And
therefore, as thou hast taught me about queens,
teach me also about kings.  What should he
be like, whom thou wouldst be willing to
follow through the world?
</p>

<p>
And she looked at him for a moment, and
then she dropped her eyes, and turned away
her head, and was silent.  And as he watched
her, the King saw the colour rising on her
neck, till it reached the roots of her dark hair,
like the flush of eve climbing the snowy
summit of Himalaya, when day is dead.  And he
said to himself in ecstasy: Ha! so this pure
digit of the ice-cold moon, even in the solitary
darkness of the night, before the dawn of love,
has dreamed of a sun which she has never seen.
And O that I could dare to think myself the
sunny lover corresponding to her dream,
destined to touch her soul, as my question did her
body, into red!  But let me beware, lest I
scare my timid fawn by a too abrupt approach.
And then he said: Dear little blue-eyed Queen,
forgive me, if I roused thy maiden shame by a
rash and ill-mannered curiosity.  It is enough
for me to know, that the king of thy pure
fancy must be worthy of his queen: and as
much above all other men, as thou art
different and above all other women.
</p>

<p>
And then, with her eyes still fixed upon the
ground, she began to draw upon the step with
her foot.  And she said softly: And in what
do I differ from all other women?  And the
King said: Blue-eyes, ask me rather in what
respect thou art the same.  For thy points of
difference are so many, that it would take long
to tell them all.  But notwithstanding, if thou
wilt, I will try, and paint thy portrait for thee
in contrast to the others, and hold thy image
up before thee, reflected on the mirror of my
soul.  And she said: Try: for I desire to learn
how I differ from the others.  Then he said:
Look, then, at me, that I may see thee before
I begin.  And she raised her eyes, and looked
straight at him, blushing a very little, and then
smiled, and looked down, and waited as he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
Then the King said: Blue-eyes, every
woman is a woman, and so art thou: and this is
what thou hast, in common with all others of
thy sex.  And yet, in every special property
of woman thou hast something of thine own,
which marks thee like a seal, and stamps thee
as a thing distinct and peculiar, and other than
them all.  For others have blue eyes, but
thine are bluer, and other lips are red, but
thine are redder, and other brows are black,
but thine is blacker, and other smiles are white,
but thine, O thine is like a snowflake or the
petal of a new young lotus bud.  Dark, dark
is hair, but thine is like the midnight, and
many feet are small, but not as thine are.
And O thy arms are softer and more rounded,
and thy waist is more enticing, and the two
proud swelling sister milky foes upon thy
breast, more erect and more provoking: and
yet thy step is lighter and thy walk is more
bewitching and thy voice's murmur sweeter
and thy laughter more delicious and thy soul
fresher and more frank and thy heart it may
be harder than that of any woman that I have
ever seen.  Moreover, all others of thy sex
are tame, and thou art wild.  Then she said:
What is the distinction, for I do not
understand?  And the King said: Sweet, I cannot
tell thee: and yet it is a difference far greater
than all the others put together.  For all
things that are tame are, as it were, an
incarnation and embodiment of the littleness of
men: but all things that are wild, as thou art,
are, as it were, a portion of the Deity.  For
thy behaviour differs from that of other
women, as does a wild vine gadding at its will
from the trained flowers in a king's garden,
and thy great blue eyes are utterly without
hypocrisy, and resemble those of a falcon or a
child.  And thou thyself art like the young
beautiful heifer of a wild white bull.  And I
know not how to tell thee what I mean, when
I say that thou art wild: and yet it is just this
very quality in thee which drives me to
distraction.  But see, now, the evening as it
falls, and the water of the great river flowing
with its surface unruffled by any breath of
wind: see, how the cranes here and there upon
the brink are mirrored in its water, and yonder
pair of swans are, as it were, echoed by
another pair that swim below them upside down;
and the peacock on the temple wall glitters in
the last rays of the sun with emerald and blue
and gold: now thou seemest, as it were, a part
of it all, and as it were the soul of all this
body, and like a jewel in its proper setting,
and at one with all the creatures of the wood.
And I begin to fear, lest thou shouldst
suddenly plunge into the water, and disappear,
leaving me alone.
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke, there came again a murmur
and a rustle in the air.  And he listened
and exclaimed with anxiety: Ha! what is that?
Then she said: It is only the beating of the
wings of the waterfowl returning to their
roost for the night.

[<a href="#chap0205fn1text">1</a>] This single word, a common name
in Sanskrit for the lotus,
possesses an incomparable, moral

which can only be poorly rendered
in English by five words
instead of one.  Mud-born is the word:
but the meaning it covers
is the pure white lotus that springs

SHADOWS
</p>

<p>
And the King drew a deep breath, like a
man saved from a great danger.  And she
saw it, and said to him: Thou art afraid.  Of
what art thou afraid?  And the King said:
Ah! dear Blue-eyes, I am indeed afraid, but
of this alone, lest something should occur to
cut short our conversation.  And shall I not
be afraid of death?  For as my life began
with the commencement of our converse, so
its end will be my death.  And like a miser,
the very treasure that I worship fills me with
despair, because the fear of losing it mixes
with the joy of its possession, and I start at
every noise.  And as I said before, more than
anything I fear lest thou shouldst suddenly
escape into the water.  And I am sorely
tempted to take hold of thee, and tie thee like
my horse to the tree, to prevent thee from
escaping.
</p>

<p>
Then she laughed and exclaimed: There is
no need: for I have no desire to escape from
thee.  And how could I plunge into the
water, unless I were a fish?  Then he said: Dear,
did thy father never tell thee of the nymphs
that have their homes beneath the water?  Or
hast thou forgotten what he said?  Or is it
as I said, that thou thyself art one of them,
seeking to deceive me?  And she said: But
what should lead thee to believe it?  And he
said: Every reason.  For they are all
marvellously beautiful, as thou art, and like thee,
they suddenly appear, seated by pools and
streams, and lure unhappy travellers like me
to ruin and destruction.  Then she said: And
by what means do they destroy them?  And
the King said: Blue-eyes, by showing
themselves for but an instant, and then
disappearing, never to return, carrying away with them
the hearts of their miserable victims, and
leaving them instead inconsolable regret, and
lovelorn longing for the beauty whose
momentary vision robbed them of their soul.
Therefore beware! and let me warn thee, that once
having shown thyself, thou art absolutely
bound to remain with me for ever: otherwise
I shall be utterly undone.  For if not, thou
wert very wrong ever to have shown thyself at
all, and deservest to be punished as a deceiver
and a Thag.
</p>

<p>
Then she laughed, with laughter that was
music to the King's ear.  And she said, softly:
But this is very hard: for how can those poor
water-women help it, and is it any fault of
theirs if they happen to be seen by those who
happen to pass by and are not blind?  Nor
was it my fault, if I was seen by thee: rather
was it thine, for coming into my wood upon
thy horse.  Then the King said: Blue-eyes, I
blame thee not at all, always provided that
thou dost not jump into the water, or leave
me in any other way.  And she said: But is
it not rather I that have to be afraid, lest thou
shouldst leave me?  Is it my sex only that
deceives, and are there no water-men, as well
as water-women?  And the King said eagerly:
Ah! dear Blue-eyes, and would it be a grief to
thee, if I should go away?  And she waited
a little while, before she replied.  And then
she said, looking at him with playful eyes:
Didst thou not say thyself that this world was
full of men?  And if, then, one has come into
the wood to-day, another may to-morrow.
And the King started, and he looked at her
with rapture.  And he said to himself: Ha! she
is provoking me, and ah! she is delicious.
Surely the very elements must have in them
the nature of a woman, since even in this empty
wood, this intoxicating maiden has somehow
or other managed to acquire the coquetry of
her sex: most of all charming there, where it
was least to be expected.  And then he said
aloud: Dear little daughter of an Apsaras, let
thine other man beware, whoever he may be: for
I will set guards about the wood, like a ring,
to put to death whoever they may find.
</p>

<p>
Then she looked at him a little while, and
she said: See, I have told thee all I have to
tell, but thou hast told me absolutely nothing.
Art thou then a king, to speak of placing
guards about the wood?  And the King said
to himself: Ha! she is clever, and has caught
me in a trap.  And yet I will not tell her who
I am, for if she knew, she might be dazzled by
my kingdom, and fall in love with that, rather
than with me.  And he said: Surely, as we
agreed in the beginning, if thou art a queen,
I must be a king.  And I will not allow any
other man to tamper with my queen.  And I
am of good caste, and a Rajpoot, and not
ashamed of my family.  But what if I were
in very truth a king, and banished: wouldst
thou follow me through the world, as thou
saidst?  And she laughed and said: Nay, but
I am not yet thy queen, and to follow thee is
not my duty, but that of thy Queen or Queens.
And the King looked at her narrowly, and
said to himself: Is she speaking at random, or
can it be that she is curious, or jealous, and
anxious to discover whether she has a rival?
And he said: Blue-eyes, King or not, this is
certain, that I neither have nor will have any
queen or queens whatever but thyself.  Nor
have I ever seen any woman in the world, till
I came into this wood, that I would wish to
make my wife.  And therefore tell me, for as
yet thou hast not answered: if I were a king
indeed, wouldst thou come away and be my
Queen?
</p>

<p>
And she said: I am of good family, and not
independent[<a id="chap0206fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn1">1</a>]; and it is not for myself, but for
my father to dispose of me.  And then, the
very instant she had spoken, she uttered a
sharp cry, and started to her feet, and stood.
And the King leaped up in terror, exclaiming:
Alas, what is the matter?  For he thought she
had been bitten by a snake.  But he looked
and saw nothing.  And he drew near her, and
saw that she was deadly pale, and drooping
like a flower left without water in the heat of
noon.  And he said again, with anxiety:
Alichumbitá: what is it?  But she never
answered, but stood silent, gazing at the river, as
though he were not there.
</p>

<p>
And the King stood just beside her, looking
at her with affection and alarm.  And now
the light was changing into darkness, for the
sun had sunk behind the western mountain,
and on the trees across the river the disc of
the full-moon was sitting waiting like a thief
watching the lord of day away before stealing
silently up into his domain.  And far away
down the river, a solitary star was shining in
the south, below in the black water, and above
in the dark blue sky, over which great bats
were flapping noiselessly, like dusky ghosts
coming by night to haunt the spots they loved
as living birds.  And the voices of the forest
day had died away, and in their place the
insects of the night were calling to one another
to begin: and all about the shadows in the
trees the fireflies were flitting in and out.
And the King heard his horse whinnying and
pawing on the ground, impatient at being tied
so long, and fretting to be gone.

<p>
And still as she did not move, at last the
King broke silence.  And he said: Dear, I
know not what is wrong, but I would give my
life, to save thee from even a very little pain.
And now the day is done, and very soon it will
be night.  Dost thou not hear the horse,
calling, and telling me it is time to be away?  And
yet I cannot leave thee, if I would.  And now
again I ask thee, wilt thou not come away with
me from this dark wood, and live and play
with me for ever, as we have done to-day?
For in the time that we have been together,
thou hast taken absolute possession of my
soul, and filled it with thyself, leaving no other
room in it, so that everything except thee is
utterly ousted and forgotten and obliterated.
And I feel as if I had known thee, not for an
hour, but for a hundred thousand years: and
it cannot be but that we were King and Queen
in many births before, and destined by reason
of the depth of our devotion to meet again in
this one also.  And I will make thy life all
that I said, and more: and I will be thy father
and thy mother and thy other self, reflecting
thee as in a mirror, joyous when thou art
joyous, and sad when thou art sad.  And if thou
dost regret to leave thy father and the wood,
no matter: for I will bring thee back to it,
as often as thou wilt.  And we will make this
little temple as it were a pleasure arbour, to
last us till we die, and remind me for ever of
the moment when I saw thy two great eyes,
like two great blue lotus flowers, looking at
me, out of the magic shadow of the wood.
</p>

<p>
And then all at once, she burst into a
passion of tears.  And she said sobbing: Now
thou must go away, almost as soon as thou art
come.  Why didst thou come into the wood,
only to destroy me?  For till I saw thee, I
was happy, and I took pleasure in the river,
and the flowers and the trees: but now they
are all become hateful in my eyes.  For I
cannot bear to let thee go, and be without thee:
and yet I cannot keep thee, or go with thee
from the wood.  And the King said, in
despair: Alas! and why canst thou not come
away?  Then she said: As my father wishes
me to marry, so I must.  But thy coming took
me by surprise, and robbed me of my reason:
and lost in the joy of thy discovery, and
watching thee, and listening to thy voice, I had
utterly forgotten everything but thee; and I
suddenly remembered, as I told thee of my
father, all about it, and now it is a grief to
me that ever I saw thee in the wood.  And
now all is over, and everything is changed,
and thou must go away at once, and leave me
to forget, if I can, that ever I have seen thee.
For I cannot disobey my father, or bring
discredit on my family, by having anything to
do with thee: for I am intended for another.
And the King exclaimed: Ah! no! it cannot
be.  Surely thou art raving.  Or who can it
be, for whom thou art preserved by thy father,
as a deposit and a trust?  And he said to
himself: Only let me learn who it is, and I will
find him, no matter who and where he is, and
rid the earth of him, and get her for myself.
</p>

<p>
Then she said: Far away in the north, on the
edge of the wood, there is a King, Rudrálaka
by name: and one day he will come into the
wood and claim me for his bride.  For so it
was revealed to my father, when he enquired
of my mother, long ago, to whom he should
give me, when I was of age.  And my mother
went to Indra, and asked him; and Indra
asked Maheshwara, who knows the present,
the future, and the past.  And how can he be
deceived, or how can that which he foretold
fail to come to pass?  And now I see very well
that it was a crime in me, ever to have had
anything to do with thee: and in the madness
produced by thy appearance, I have acted in
a manner unworthy of my caste: for I am the
promised bride of another man.  And now
there is nothing but for thee to go away as
quickly as thou canst, and forget that ever
thou didst see me in the wood.
</p>

<p>
And the King stood still behind her as she
spoke, filled with amazement and relief.  And
he watched her weeping, with pride and
delight; and he said to himself: Certainly she is
of good family, and its very crest-jewel, and
like a diamond of pure water; for she will not
come away with me, but is faithful to her duty,
even against her will.  But once again I will
test her, like gold in the fire, before I tell her
who I am.  But what, if she does not stand
the test?  Why, then I will forgive her: for
how could I blame her for yielding and
allowing herself to be defeated in my cause?  But
if she stands firm, and resists me, then I shall
know that my pearl is priceless, and my
emerald without a flaw.
</p>

<p>
And then he said aloud: Out upon this
Rudrálaka, for he is like a cloud that has suddenly
intervened, to cast a dark and horrid shadow
over our sunny garden of delight, and an
obstacle which only the lord of obstacles can
move.  And what is this Rudrálaka, to
prevail over the lord of the elephant face in
conjunction with the God who has flowers for his
bow?[<a id="chap0207fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0207fn1">1</a>]  And cannot I persuade thee to forget,
one whom thou hast never even seen, and who
is to thee nothing but a name?  And who
knows even whether he exists at all, and is not
merely a dream of thy father's, an illusion
brought into his aged head by weakness
arising from severe emaciation?  And wilt thou
then sacrifice thy happiness and mine to a
dream?  And he waited for a moment, and he
said: See, thou art undecided, wavering
between thy duty and my love, like a flower
shaken by opposing breezes.  A flower thou
art, and a flower shall decide for thee.  And
this red lotus, which has lingered so long near
thy heart that it must know it, and resembles
it in colour, shall be the oracle of thy destiny.
And he leaned over her, and took very gently,
without touching her, the lotus on her breast,
and drew it away, while she offered no resistance.
And he said: One petal is for thee, and
one for me.  Now will I pluck the petals one
by one, first for thee, and second for myself.
And if thine is the last, thou shalt stay, and I
will go away without thee: and if mine, thou
shall cast away Rudrálaka, like the stalk when
it is stripped of the leaves, and forget him, and
come with me and be my wife.
</p>

<p>
And then, one by one, he began to strip the
red lotus of its leaves, and let them fall upon
the ground, saying as he did so: This, for thee:
this, for me.  And as he counted, she watched
him, with tears sparkling in her eyes, till only
one remained.  And he held it out towards
her, saying, with a smile: This, for me.  And
then, all at once she broke into a laugh that
was mingled with sobs and sorrow and
indignation.  And she exclaimed: Ah! thou art
cunning, and thou art very cruel.  Thou
knewest very well that there were but sixteen
petals on the lotus,[<a id="chap0207fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0207fn2">2</a>] and that thine must be the
last.  And thou art unkind, prolonging my
torture, and striving, by unfairness, and
temptation, to recall my resolution: yet if I did,
thou wouldst only think the worse of me, even
though thine would be the gain.  Go, go
quickly, for I may not come away with thee.
And as she spoke, she turned paler than the
<i>Kumuda</i> that opens in the dusk, and
staggered.  And she leaned against a pillar of
the tree, and her eyes shone in the moonlight,
and she said very quietly: Go now, take thy
horse, and go away; and go very quickly: for
the decision is too hard for me, and I cannot
bear it very long.  And it would be a stain on
thee, to tempt any longer the wife of another
man.
</p>

<p>
And the King gazed at her, struck with
admiration and amazement.  And he said to
himself: Ha! where is the simple forest maiden
who sat to listen at my feet, for in her place
I see one whose virtue I have roused, and who
orders me to go with the dignity of an insulted
queen?  And I stand before her like a
culprit, rejoicing inwardly at the failure of my
own attempt.  And as he stood, lost in
wonder at her moonlit unearthly beauty, and
ready to fall and worship at her feet, suddenly
there fell upon his ear a murmur and a rustle
in the air.  And he listened, and all at once
the horse began to neigh; for it was the
trample of horses and the thunder of their
hoofs.  And as they looked, lo! a band of
horsemen issued from the wood, and came
towards them; and in a moment they were
surrounded by the attendants of the King.

QUINTESSENCE
</p>

<p>
And then, with a cry, Alichumbitá sprang
back, and stood in dismay, on the very brink
of the river, looking from the King to his
followers and back again.  And the King
watched her with ecstasy, and he said to
himself: Now could I almost forgive my
attendants for this exasperating interruption.  For
she looks like a stag whose retreat has been cut
off by the hunters, standing at bay, with
every graceful limb quivering and poised on
the very verge of instant action, striking terror
as it were into even the hearts of her pursuers
by her magnificent defiance, and cowing them
by the startled pride of her haughty and yet
timid eyes, and holding them as it were
spellbound by the beautiful agitation incarnate in
her form, and reaching its supreme expression
in the deep heave of her glorious bosom.  And
I can see that my followers are divided in
their minds: for all their respect for me cannot
prevent them from transferring their
allegiance to her, and doing homage to the true
deity manifest in her lovely shape.  Ha! beauty
is the real ruler of the three worlds, and
all others are usurpers and pretenders and
emptiness and show.  For if I were unknown
to them, my followers would pay me no
regard at all: whereas they have all become
slaves to my mistress, as I did myself, by a
single glance at her goddess mien.
</p>

<p>
And then, as his attendants dismounted
from their horses, and stood before him in
attitudes of respect, the King called to his
chief huntsman.  And he said to him: Tell
this lady who they are that stand before her.
Then that huntsman said with deference:
Lady, we are a very few of the devoted
followers of King Rudrálaka: and having hunted
for him all day long, we pray now to be
forgiven, if we have succeeded at last in finding
him only to be troublesome by our intrusion.
And the King said: Now go, taking my
horse; and wait for me a little way off, yet
not beyond a call.  Then those huntsmen all
retired, stealing glances as they went at the
King's companion, and vanished again within
the wood.
</p>

<p>
And when they were gone, the King stood
awhile in silence, gazing with affection at
Alichumbitá, who was lost in confusion and
astonishment.  And then he said: Blue-eyes,
now thou hast heard.  And will thou now do
thy duty, and obey thy father, and justify the
Great God's foresight, and come away with thy
true husband and be his Queen?  Or hast
thou still a horror of King Rudrálaka?
Ah! forgive me for trying thee, a thing which I
cannot, nevertheless, regret.  For thou wert
proof against my bribes, and hast doubled the
worth of thy wondrous beauty by exhibiting
the quality of its inner soul.  And she stood
for a moment, changing colour, first red, and
then white, as if the blood which had mantled
in her face had like those huntsmen withdrawn
again into the wood of her heart from modesty
at the sight of him.  And as he took her by
the hand, she hid her face against his breast,
laughing as she wept, and raining as it were
nectar with her tears into the heart of the
King.  So they stood together in the silence,
while the King stroked her dark hair gently
with his left hand.  And at last he said: Sweet
little Queen, thou hast seen men enough now,
for one day.  Know, that they are all thy
servants, from the King down.
</p>

<p>
And suddenly, she raised her face, and
looked at him with eyes that were full of smiles
and tears and shyness and playfulness and blue
colour and the tremble of the moon.  And she
said: Canst thou tell of what I thought, as I
looked upon all those men?  And he said: Of
what?  Then she said: They seemed to me to
be worthy only to be servants to such as thee:
and I saw that it was as I had thought, and
that mine was a man even among men.  And
then she stopped, and she said again in a low
voice: Now, if thou wilt, I wilt give thee an
answer to that question of thine which I left
unanswered.  And the King said: Which?
And she said: Dost thou not remember?  Thou
didst ask me, what was he like whom I would
follow through the world.  Now canst thou
guess, or shall I tell thee?  And the King
leaned over her, bending her a little back as
she lay in his strong arms, and as she closed
her eyes, he kissed her trembling lips, which
shrank a little from the touch of his own.  And
after a while, he looked, and saw heaven
reflected in the eyes of his wife beneath him, and
beyond them, their two shadows, clinging
together, black on the moonlit ground.  And
suddenly he pointed, and said to her: See, thy
wish is gratified, and thy shadow has come to
life.  And she put both her arms round his
neck, and drew him down, and kissed him
again.  And she said: It is not my shadow,
but it is I myself that have come to life, and
thou art the life that has come to me.  And
hadst thou gone away without me, I should
not be living now: for I would have thrown
myself into the river, the moment I was alone.
And the King said, with a smile: Did I not
tell thee, that I feared lest thou shouldst
plunge into the river?  And she laughed, and
said: Let me go, and see.  And they looked
at each other for a moment, and laughed
without a reason.  And they embraced each other
passionately, and the King said: Give me now
another kiss.  So she did.  And he said: Now
another, and another.  And so they continued,
she giving and he receiving; while the night
passed away.
</p>

<p>
And at last he said: Now I must carry my
property away with me, for thou art no longer
thy father's but mine.  And we will come
again, and tell thy father, but in the meantime,
I will take thee, for never will I part from
thee again.  And she said: Do with me as
thou wilt: so only that thou dost not leave me.
</p>

<p>
Then he said: Blue-eyes, thou hast seen a
horse to-day for the first time, and now thou
shalt ride one also.  And she said with a
smile: But how can I ride without falling?
Then he said: Fear nothing.  Dost thou think
that I would trust my treasure on a horse
alone?  But that good horse, which brought
into the wood to-day a single rider, shall carry
back a pair.  And he has run a race to-day
that will have robbed him of his fire.  Wait,
now, there, for a little while, till I return: and
beware! that thou dost not jump into the
water.  And as she smiled, they kissed each other
again with insatiable lips.  And then he went
towards the wood, and shouted for his men.
And when they came, he gave them orders,
and they brought his horse, and prepared him
as he said, placing for her reception soft
rugs upon his back.  And the King mounted,
and he said: Watch me when I go, and
follow me at a distance.  And then he rode
back to where she waited for him by the river bank.
</p>

<p>
Then he came close up to her and said:
Give me now thy left hand, and place thy little
foot on mine, and I will lift thee up before
me.  So she stretched out to him her hand,
shrinking from the horse as it tossed its head
and trampled the ground, and seeking with
timidity for an opportunity to place her foot
upon his own.  So as she waited, gazing at
the horse with doubtful eyes, the King
laughed.  And he exclaimed: This way will
not do, and now I must make another.  And
suddenly, he turned the horse towards her with
his knee, and letting fall the reins, he leaned
from the saddle and caught her in his arms,
and lifted her up before him.  And at that
moment the horse started off, and the King
felt for the reins with his left hand, holding
her in his right arm, while she clung to his
neck for fear of falling.  And for a while
the King let the horse go, for the sweetness
of her terrified embrace was such that he
said to himself: Ah! could this only last for
ever!
</p>

<p>
Then after a while, he checked the horse,
and brought him to a walk.  And as they
went slowly through the forest, now in the
shadow and now in the moonlit glades, he let
the reins fall on his horse's neck, and took his
wife in both his arms, kissing her lips that
kissed him again, and murmuring inarticulately
words without a meaning, and filling
his soul to the very brim with the intoxication
of her shadowy eyes and the perfume of her
hair that hung about her escaping from its
knot.  And suddenly, there came as it were
night over his eyes.  And he felt her slipping
from his embrace, which closed in vain on
empty air.  And before him her face wavered
and flickered, and it lit up like a dying lamp
for a single instant with vivid brightness, and
then went out and disappeared.

ECHOES AND REGRETS
</p>

<p>
And in an instant, he saw before him, no
wood and no horse.  But he found himself
floating as at first like a cloud in the blue sky,
with his wife still in his arms.  And he said:
Ha! how is this?  I lost thee but now in the
forest, and here we are together in the sky.
But I seem to have but just awoken from a
dream.  And wert thou then with me in my
dream?  Then she said: Yes.  And as she
spoke, she caught him in a convulsive grasp,
for she knew that the end was come.  And as
she gazed at him with agony in her eyes, he
said: Ah!  dost thou remember how we rode
together, and lingered as I brought thee home,
in that delicious wood?  Dost thou remember
how we laughed, and how we wept for joy?
Dost thou remember how at last thou didst fall
asleep from sheer fatigue, and I carried thee
sleeping home?  Dost thou remember how I
sat and watched thee in thy sleep, and how at
thine awakening thou wast frightened,
forgetting where thou wert?  Dost thou
remember, how everything was new to thee, and
strange, and how all day long I laughed for
joy to see thee, my plaything and my pretty
child?  Dost thou remember how we played
at King and Queen, counting the whole world
as a straw, and never parting, night or day?
Dost thou remember how thou wast by day,
the sun, and by night, the moon, of all the
hours, lighting up my gloomy palace with the
blaze of thy beauty and the soft light of thy
love?  Dost thou remember how thy voice
echoed in my empty halls, and thy laughter
filled up all its corners with music and delight?
Dost thou remember how I used to follow thee
about from room to room, and how sometimes,
rogue!  thou wouldst hide from me, to drive me
to despair?  Dost thou remember that last
night, when I parted from thee to go to war,
leaving my soul behind?  But ah! alas! for
the day, when I rode like a whirlwind into
the court, and they told me of thy death!
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke, there shot through his
heart a mortal pang like a sharp sword.  And
at that instant, his wife vanished, and he felt
himself falling, falling like a heavy stone, down
through empty space.  And he uttered a
fearful cry, for he understood that he was
returning swiftly back to earth.  And struggling
with vain and frenzied grief and rage, he
screamed aloud, in the ecstasy of despair:
Ah! my wife! my wife!  Ah! not to earth! ah! not
again! not without thee! not without thee!

Epilogue
</p>

<p>
But in the meanwhile, the King's attendants
sat on in the palace hall, waiting while the
King slept.  And he slept on, while they
waited, and they watched him lying very still,
on his couch upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
So as they watched and waited, the day
slowly passed away.  And hour succeeded
hour, as the sun moved steadily on to his home
behind the western hill.  And all the while, the
old merchant remained motionless in his place,
stiller even than the sleeping King, for he
never even breathed.  So they watched and
waited on, till for very weakness their souls
were almost parting from their bodies, and
slumber began to steal over their eyes.  And
day began to turn to twilight, and the
darkness began as it were to gather and creep out
of the corners of the room, in which was heard
no sound, save the deep breathing of the
sleeping King.
</p>

<p>
And suddenly, like a flash of lightning,
there rang through that silent room a cry,
that pierced those weary watchers' ears like
the point of a molten spear; for it resembled
the cry of a woman, forced by the agony of
abject fear into the very mouth of death.  And
as they bounded to their feet, and looked
towards the King, there burst from his heart
another cry, and yet another.  And they saw
his body, like a worm, writhing and quivering
as it lay; and all at once he leaped from the
couch and stood erect, and staggered across
the floor.
</p>

<p>
And he stood there, swaying like a reed,
and gazing straight before him, seeing
nothing, with open eyes, that were dazed with the
depth of their own despair.  And every limb
of his body shook, and drops of sweat stood
on his brow, and his breath came hard and fast
and hoarse, from a chest that heaved and
trembled like the bosom of a frightened girl.
So he stood, while they all watched him, silent
and aghast, and listening as it were to the
beating of their own hearts.
</p>

<p>
So as they watched him, holding their
breath, he began to wail like a child.  And he
wept aloud, with great sobs, that shook him
from head to foot, till the tears rose and stood
in the eyes of all that saw him, as if drawn
from their sources by the sight of his own,
which fell on the ground like rain.  And all at
once, he stopped short.  And he looked up,
and stared before him, with weeping and
imploring eyes, that hunted as it were among
them for something they could not find.
</p>

<p>
And as they watched him silently, spellbound
by those troubled eyes, they saw their
expression alter, and over them pass a dreadful
change, till like a fire they shone with scorn
and hatred and disdain.  And he stepped
forward, and spat at them all as they stood before
him, stretching out both his arms.  And as
he did so, his gaze was as it were caught by
the glitter of the glancing gems that hung
upon his wrists.  And he looked at them for
a moment, and suddenly he took those jewels
and tore them from his hands and arms, and
from his neck and breast.  And he broke them
all to pieces, snapping asunder cords and
chains, and tossed all over the palace hall
pearls and rubies and all the rest, till they
rattled on the floor like hail.  And when he had
no more jewels to tear, he fell upon his clothes;
and he stripped them off him with giant
strength, and rent them into bits and shreds,
till he stood before them breathing hard,
dripping with sweat, and bleeding, as naked as he
was born.
</p>

<p>
And as his eyes ran over them all as they
shrank before him, they fell suddenly upon the
old merchant, who sat still in the self-same
place, never having stirred.  So when the
King saw him, suddenly he began to laugh,
with laughter that was divided from sobbing
by only a single hair.  And he exclaimed:
Ha! old vendor, art thou there, waiting for thy
price?  For now my dream is over, and it
only remains to pay.  Take for thy dream,
my whole kingdom, and all that it contains.
And even so, thou art unpaid: for such a
dream could not be ransomed, even by the three
great worlds.
</p>

<p>
And then, with anguish in his eyes, he threw
his arms to heaven.  And he uttered a long
low cry, like the howl of a dog whose lord is
dead, and turned, and ran out of the hall.
</p>

<p>
And they stood, like pictures on a wall,
while the sound of his disappearing steps died
away upon their ears.  And then in an
instant, the hall was filled with tumult.  But the
King's physician rushed forward.  And he
exclaimed: The King's frenzy has come again,
and much I fear, that it will never again
depart.  But as for this old merchant, who has
given the King a deadly drug, let him not
escape.  Seize him, and let him answer for the
madness of the King.
</p>

<p>
Then the guards surrounded that old
merchant, but he never moved or stirred.  And
suddenly, seized with anger, the captain of
the guards stooped down, and seized him by
the beard, to drag him roughly to his feet.
And lo! that old man's head came off his neck,
and hung by the beard in his hand.  And they
looked, and saw, that the body was hollow, and
empty, and without a soul, like the trunk of a
withered tree.
</p>

<p>
Then they gazed at one another, with open
mouths, and eyes that were dull with fear.
And after a while, the chaplain spoke.  And
he said slowly: Surely this was an old
Rákshasa, playing with the King's life.  Or who
knows?  For it may be, the Deity took this
form, to punish the King, by means of a
dream, for the sins of a former birth.

Preface
</p>

<p>
More generally known, perhaps, than any
other Hindoo legend, is the story of the demon,
RÁHU, who brings about ECLIPSES, by
devouring the Sun and Moon.  For when the
gods had upchurned the nectar, the delectable
Butter of the Brine, Ráhu's mouth watered at
the very sight of it: and "in the guise of a
god" he mingled unperceived among them,
to partake.  But the Sun and Moon, the
watchful Eyes of Night and Day, detected
him, and told Wishnu, who cast at him his
discus, and cut his body from his head: but
not until the nectar was on the way down his
throat.  Hence, though the body died, the
head became immortal: and ever since, a thing
unique, "no body and all head," a byword
among philosophers, he takes revenge on Sun
and Moon, the great Taletellers, by
"gripping" them in his horrid jaws, and holding on,
till he is tired, or can be persuaded to let go.
Hence, in some parts of India, the doleful
shout of the country people at eclipses: <i>Chor
do! chor do!</i>[<a id="chap0300fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0300fn1">1</a>] and hence, also, the primary and
surface meaning of our title: <i>A Digit of the
Moon in the Demon's grip</i>: in plain English,
an eclipse of the moon.  And yet, legend
though it be, there is something in the old
mythological way of putting the case, which
describes the situation in eclipses far better
than our arid scientific prose.  I shall not
easily forget, how, as we slid like ghosts at
midnight, through the middle of the desert,
along the Suez Canal,[<a id="chap0300fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0300fn2">2</a>] I watched the ghastly
pallor of the wan unhappy moon, as the
horrible shadow crept slowly over her face,
stealing away her beauty, and turning the lone and
level sands that stretched away below to a
weird and ashy blue, as though covering the
earth with a sepulchral sympathetic pall.  For
we caught the "griesly terror," Ráhu, at his
horrid work, towards the end of May, four
years ago.
</p>

<p>
But our title has yet another meaning
underneath the first, for <i>Ahi</i>, the name employed
for Ráhu (like all other figures in Indian
mythology, he is known by many names), also
means a <i>snake</i>.  <i>Beauty persecuted by a
snake</i> is the subject of the story.  That story
will presently explain itself: but the relation
between <i>Ráhu</i>, or eclipses, and a snake is so
curiously illustrated by a little insignificant
occurrence that happened to myself, that the
reader will doubtless forgive me for making
him acquainted with it.

Being at Delhi, not many years ago, I seized
the opportunity to visit the Kutub Minár.
There was famine in the land.  At every
station I had passed upon the way were piled the
hides of bullocks, and from the train you might
see their skeletons lying, each one bleaching
where it died for want of fodder, scattered
here and there on the brown and burning
earth; for even every river bed was waterless,
and not a single blade of green could you
descry, for many hundred miles.  And hence
it came about, that as I gazed upon the two
emaciated hacks that were to pull me from the
station, a dozen miles out, and as many more
back, I could bring myself to sit behind them
only by the thought that thereby I should
save them from a load far greater than my
own, that would have been their fate on my
refusal.  Therefore we started, and did
ultimately arrive, in the very blaze of noon.
</p>

<p>
The Kutub Minár is a needle of red stone,
that rises from a plain as flat as paper to a
height of two hundred and fifty feet; and you
might compare it, as you catch, approaching,
glimpses of it at a distance, to a colossal
chimney, a Pharos, or an Efreet of the Jinn.  The
last would be the best.  For nothing on the
surface of the earth can parallel the scene of
desolation which unrolls itself below, if you
climb its 380 steps and look out from the dizzy
verge: a thing that will test both the muscle
of your knees and the steadiness of your
nerves.  Round you is empty space: look
down, the pillar bends and totters, and you
seem to rock in air; you shudder, you are
falling: and away, away below, far as the eye
can carry, you see the dusty plain, studded
with a thousand tombs and relics of forgotten
kings.  There is the grim old fortress of the
Toghlaks: there is the singular observatory of
the rájá astronomer, Jaya Singh: and there
the tomb, Humaioon's tomb, before which
Hodson, Hodson the brave, Hodson the
slandered, Hodson the unforgotten, sat, for two
long hours, still, as if man and horse were
carved in stone, with the hostile crowd that
loathed and feared him tossing and seething
and surging round him, waiting for the last
Mogul to come out and be led away.  The air
is thick, and sparkles with blinding dust and
glare, and the wind whistles in your ears.
Over the bones of dynasties, the hot wind wails
and sobs and moans.  Aye! if a man seeks for
melancholy, I will tell him where to find
it&mdash;at the top of the old Kutub Minár.
</p>

<p>
And then, that happened which I had
foreseen.  We had not gone a mile upon our
homeward way, when one of the horses fell.
Therefore, disregarding the asseverations of
my rascally Jehu that the remaining animal
was fully equal to the task alone, I descended,
and proceeded on foot.  But a ten-mile walk
on the Delhi plain in the hottest part of the
day is not a thing to be recommended.  After
plodding on for about two hours, I was, like
Langland, "wery forwandred," and went me
to rest, not alas! by a burnside, but in the
shadow of one of the innumerable little tombs
that stand along the dusty road.  There I lay
down and fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
Nothing induces slumber like exertion
under an Indian sun.  When I awoke, that sun
was setting.  A little way before me, the
yellow walls of Delhi were bathed in a ruddy
glow; the minarets of the Great Mosque stood
out sharp against the clear unspotted amber
sky.  And as I watched them, I suddenly
became aware that I was myself observed with
interest by a dusky individual, who was
squatted just in front of me, and who rose,
salaaming, when he saw that I was awake.  It
appeared that I had, so to say, fallen into a
"nest of vipers "; that I had unwittingly
invaded the premises of a snake dealer, who, no
doubt for solid reasons, had made my friendly
tomb the temporary repository of his stock-in-trade.
</p>

<p>
The Indian snake charmer, <i>gáruda, hawadiga</i>,[<a id="chap0300fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0300fn3">3</a>]
or whatever else they call him, is as a
rule but a poor impostor.  He goes about
with one fangless cobra, one rock snake, and
one miserable mongoose, strangling at the end
of a string.  My dweller in tombs was richer
than all his tribe in his snakes, and in his eyes.
I have never seen anybody else with real cat's
eyes: eyes with exactly that greenish yellow
luminous glare which you see when you look
at a cat in the dark.  They gleamed and rolled
in the evening sun, over a row of shining teeth,
as their owner squatted down before me,
liberating one after another from little bags and
baskets an amazing multitude of snakes, which
he fetched in batches from the interior of the
tomb, till the very ground seemed alive with
them.[<a id="chap0300fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0300fn4">4</a>]  Some of them he handled only with
the greatest respect, and by means of an iron
prong.  Outside the Zoo (where they lose in
effect) I never saw so many together before:
and it is only when you see a number of these
reptiles together that you realise what a
strange uncanny being, after all, is a snake:
and as you watch him, lying, as it were, in
wait, beautiful exceedingly, but with a beauty
that inspires you with a shudder, his eyes full
of cruelty and original sin, and his tongue of
calumny and malice, you begin to understand
his influence in all religions.  I was wholly
absorbed in their snaky evolutions, and buried in
mythological reminiscences, when my <i>gáruda</i>
roused me suddenly, by saying: <i>Huzoor</i>, look!
</p>

<p>
He leaned over, and administered with his
bare hand a vicious dig to a magnificent
hamadryad that lay coiled upon itself in its
open basket.  The creature instantly sat up,
with a surge of splendid passion, hissing,
bowing, and expanding angrily its great tawny
hood.  The <i>gáruda</i> put his <i>púngí</i> to his lips,
and blew for a while upon it a low and wheezy
drone,&mdash;the invariable prelude to a little
<i>jadoo</i>, or black art,&mdash;which the beautiful animal
appeared to appreciate: and then, pointing
with the end of his pipe to the "spectacles"
on its hood, he said, with that silky,
insinuating smile which is characteristic of the
scamp: <i>Huzoor, dekko, namas karta[<a id="chap0300fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0300fn5">5</a>]</i>:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Nágki phani, chánd ka dúkh<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I did not understand his lunar allusion, but,
judging that his rhyming gibberish, like that
of the rascally priests in Apuleius, was a
carefully prepared oracle of general application,
kept in stock for the cozening of such prey as
myself, I repeated to him my favourite Hindu
proverb,[<a id="chap0300fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0300fn7">7</a>] and gave him in exchange for his
benevolent cheque on the future, a more
commonplace article of present value, which led
to our parting on the most amicable terms.
But I did him injustice, perhaps.  Long
afterwards, having occasion to consult an
astronomical chart, with reference to this very
story, all at once I started, and in an instant,
the golden evening, the walls of Delhi, and my
friend of the many snakes and sinister eyes,
suddenly rose up again into my mind.  For
there, staring at me out of the chart, was the
mark on the cobra's head.  It is the sign still
used in modern astronomy for "the head and
tail of the dragon," the nodes indicating the
point of occultation, the symbol of eclipse.
</p>

<p>
What then induced or inspired the <i>gáruda</i>
to connect me with the moon?  Was it really
black art, divination, or was it only a
coincidence?  Reason recommends the latter
alternative: and yet, the contrary persuasion is
not without its charm.  Who knows?  It
may be that the soul grows to its atmosphere
as well as the body, and living in a land where
dreams are realities, and all things are
credible, and history is only a fairy tale&mdash;the land
of the moon and the lotus and the snake, old
gods and old ruins, former births, second
sight, and idealism&mdash;it falls back,
unconsciously mesmerised, under the spell of
forgotten creeds.

There lived of old, on the edge of the
desert, a rájá of the race of the sun.  And
like that sun reflected at midday in the glassy
depths of the Mánasa lake, he had an image
of himself in the form of a son,[<a id="chap0301fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn2">2</a>] who exactly
resembled him in every particular, except age.
And he gave him the name of Aja, for he said:
He is not another, but my very self that has
conquered death, and passed without birth
straight over into another body.  Moreover,
he will resemble his ancestor, and the god after
whom I have called him Aja.[<a id="chap0301fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0301fn3">3</a>]  So as this son
grew up, his father's delight in him grew
greater also.  For he was tall as a <i>shála</i> tree,
and very strong, and yet like another God of
Love: for his face was more beautiful than the
face of any woman, with large eyes like
lapis-lazuli, and lips like laughter incarnate: so that
his father, as often as he looked at him, said
to himself: Surely the Creator has made a
mistake, and mixed up his male and female
ingredients, and made him half and half.  For
if only he had had a twin sister, it would have
been difficult to tell with certainty which was
which.
</p>

<p>
And then, when Aja was eighteen, his
father died.  And immediately, his relations
conspired against him, led by his maternal
uncle.  And they laid a plot, and seized him
at night, and bound him when he was asleep:
for they dared not attack him when he was
awake, for fear of his courage and his
prodigious strength.  And they deliberated over him,
as he lay bound, what they should do with him:
and some of them were for putting him to
death, then and there.  But the prime
minister, who was in the plot, persuaded them to
let him live, saying to himself: In this way I
shall make for myself a loophole of escape, in
case he should ever regain his throne.
</p>

<p>
Then in the early morning, his uncle and his
other relations took him away, and laid him
bound on a swift camel.  And mounting
others, they hurried him away into the desert,
going at full speed for hours, till they reached
its very heart.  And there they set him down.
And they placed beside him a little water in
a small skin, and a little bag of corn.  And his
uncle said: Now, O nephew, we will leave thee,
alone with thy shadow and thy life in the sand.
And if thou canst save thyself by going away
to the western quarter, lo! it is open before
thee.  But beware of attempting to return
home, towards the rising sun.  For I will
set guards to watch thy coming, and I will not
spare thee a second time.
</p>

<p>
And then, he set his left arm free, and laid
beside him a little knife.  And they mounted
their camels, and taking his, they flew away
from him over the sand, like the shadow of a
cloud driven by the western wind.
</p>

<p>
So when they were gone, Aja took the knife,
and cut his bonds.  And he stood up, and
watched them going, till they became specks
on the edge of the desert and vanished out of
his sight.

Then he looked round to the eight quarters
of the world, and he looked up into the sky.
And he said to himself: There is my ancestor,
alone above, and I am alone, below.  And he
put his two hands to his breast, and flung
them out into the air.  And he exclaimed:
<i>Bho!</i> ye guardians of the world,[<a id="chap0302fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0302fn1">1</a>] ye are my
witnesses.  Thus do I fling away the past,
and now the whole wide world is mine, and
ye are my protectors.  And I have escaped
death by a miracle, and the craft of that old
villain of a prime minister, whom I will one
day punish as he deserves.  And now it is as
though I knew, for the very first time in all
my life, what it was to be alive.  Ha!  I live
and breathe, and there before me is food
and water.  And now we will see which is
the stronger: Death in the form of this lonely
desert, or the life that laughs at his menace
as it dances in my veins.  And little I care for
the loss of my kingdom, now that my father is
dead and gone.  I throw it away like a blade
of grass, and so far from lamenting, I feel
rather as if I had been born again.  Ha! it
is good to be alive, even in this waste of sand.
And he shouted aloud, and called out to the
sun above him: Come, old Grandfather, thou
and I will travel together across the sand.
And yet, no.  Thou art too rapid and too
fierce to be a safe companion, even for one of
thine own race.  So thou shalt go before me,
as is due to thee, and I will follow after.
</p>

<p>
And then, he lay down on the sand, covering
his head with his upper garment, and slept and
waited all day long, till the sun was going
down.  And then he rose, and ate and drank
a very little, and taking with him his skin and
corn, he walked on after the sun, which sank
to his rest in the western mountain.  But Aja
followed him all night long, with the moon for
his only companion.  And as he went, he saw
the bones of men and camels, lying along the
sand, and grinning at him as it were with
white and silent laughter, as though to say:
Anticipate thy fate: for but a little further
on, and thou shalt be what we are now.  But
he went on with nimble feet, like one that
hurries through the den of a sleeping hungry lion,
till the sun rose at last behind him.  And then
again he lay down, and rested all day long, and
started again at night.  And so he proceeded
for many days till all his water and corn were
gone.  And as he threw away the skin, he set
his teeth, and said: No matter.  I will reach
the end of this hideous sand, which, like the
dress of Draupadi,[<a id="chap0302fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0302fn2">2</a>] seems to roll itself out as
I go across it, though I should have to go
walking on long after I am dead.
</p>

<p>
And night after night he went on, growing
every night a little weaker.  And then at last
there came a night when as he toiled along
with heavy steps that flagged as it were with
loaded feet, faint with hunger and burning
thirst, he said to himself: I am nearly spent,
and now the end is coming near, either of the
sand, or of me.  And then the sun rose behind
him, and he looked up, and lo! it was reflected
from the wall of a city before him, which
resembled another sun of hope rising in the west
to cheer him.  And he rubbed his eyes, and
looked again, saying to himself: Is it a
delusion of the desert, to mock me as I perish, or is
it really a true city?  And he said again:
Ha! it is a real city.  And his ebbing strength
came back to him with a flood of joy.  And
he stopped, and took up a little sand, and
turned, and threw it back, exclaiming: Out
upon thee, abode of death![<a id="chap0302fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0302fn3">3</a>]  Now, then, I
have beaten thee, and thy victim will after all
escape.  And he hurried on towards the city,
half afraid to take his eyes away from it for
a single instant, lest it should disappear.
</p>

<p>
So as he drew near it, he saw a crowd upon
its wall.  And when he was distant from it
but a little way, suddenly its great gate's
mouth was thrown open, and a stream of
people shot from it like a long tongue, and rapidly
came towards him, so that he said to himself:
Ha! then, as it seems, I am expected by the
citizens of this delightful city, who are as
eager to come to me as I am to get to them.
And they came closer, clamouring and buzzing
as it were like bees; and he looked, and lo! they
were all women, and there was not a man
among them all.  And as he wondered, they
ran up, and reached him, and threw themselves
upon him like a wave of the sea, laughing and
crying, and drowning him in their embraces:
and they took him as it were captive, and
swept him away towards the city, all talking
at once, and deafening him with their joyful
exclamations, paying not the least attention
to anything that he tried to say.  And Aja
let himself go, carried away by all those women
like a leaf in a rushing stream.  And he said
to himself, in astonishment: What is this great
wonder?  For all these women fight for me,
as if they had never seen a man in their lives
before.  Where then can the men be, to whom
they must belong?  Or can it be that I have
come to a city composed of women without a
man?  Have I escaped the desert only to
be drowned in a sea of women?  For what is
the use of a single man in an ocean of the
other sex?  Or are they dragging me away to
offer me up to the Mother,[<a id="chap0302fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0302fn4">4</a>] having sacrificed
all their own husbands already?  Or have I
really died in the desert, and is all this only a
dream of the other world?  Can these be the
heavenly Apsarases, come in a body to fetch
me away, as if I had fallen in battle?  Surely
they are, for some of them are sufficiently
beautiful even for Indra's hall.  And
anyhow, it is better to be torn to pieces
by beautiful women, even if there are far
too many, than to die in the desert, all
alone.
</p>

<p>
So as they bore him along, chattering on
like jays and cranes, he said again to the
women next him: Fair ones, who are you, and
where are you taking me, and why in the world
are you so greatly delighted to see me?  And
then at last, they replied: O handsome
stranger, ask nothing: very soon thou shalt know all,
for we are carrying thee away to our King.
And Aja said to himself: Ha!  So, then,
there is a King.  These women have, after all,
a King.  Truly, I am fain to see him, this
singular King of a female city.  And weak
as he was, he began to laugh, as they all were
laughing: and so they all surged on like a very
sea of laughter, through the gates of the city,
and along the streets within, till they came at
last to the King's palace.  And all the way,
Aja looked, and there was not to be seen so
much as the shadow of a man in all the streets,
which overflowed with women like the channel
of a river in the rainy season.
</p>

<p>
Then the guards of the palace doors, who
were also women, took him, and led him in;
and all the women who had brought him
crowded in behind.  And they mounted stairs,
and after a while, they entered at last a great
hall, whose pillars of alabaster were reflected
in its dark green crystal floor, giving it the
semblance of a silent pool in which a multitude
of colossal swans had buried their necks
beneath the water.  And there Aja found
himself in the presence of the King.
</p>

<p>
And instantly, all the women screamed
together: Victory to thee, Maharájá! for here
have we brought thee another husband for thy
lovely daughter.  And Aja started.  And he
said to himself: Another husband!  How
many husbands, then, has this strange King's
daughter got already?  Has she an insatiable
thirst for husbands, whose number I am
brought to swell?  So as he stood reflecting,
the King leaped from his throne, and came
towards him.  And as Aja looked at him, he
was seized with amazement greater than
before.  For the King resembled a very
incarnation of the essence of grief, yet such that
it was difficult to behold him without laughter,
as if the Creator had made him to exhibit
skill in combining the two.  For his long thin
hair was pure white, as if with sorrow, and his
eyes were red, as if with weeping, and great
hollow ruts were furrowed in his sunk and
withered cheeks, as if the tears had worn
themselves channels in which to run.  And though
he was tall, he was bent and old, as if bowed
down by a load of care.  And he tried, as if
in vain, to smile, as he said in a mournful voice
that quavered and cracked: O man, whoever
thou art, long have I waited for thee, and glad
indeed I am to see thee, and inclined to dance
like a peacock at the sight of a rainy cloud.
</p>

<p>
And as he gazed upon the King, Aja was
seized with sudden laughter that would not be
controlled, saying within himself: Much in
common they have between them, a dancing
happy peacock, and this doleful specimen of
a weeping King!  And he laughed till tears
ran down his cheeks also, as if in imitation of
those of the King.  And when at last he could
speak, he said: O King, forgive me.  For I
am very weak, and have come within a little of
dying in the desert.  And I laughed from
sheer exhaustion, and for joy to see in thy
person as it were the warrant of my escape from
death.  Give me food, and above all, water, if
thou wouldst not have me die at thy feet.  And
afterwards, show me, if thou wilt, thy daughter,
to whom, as it seems, I am to be married
whether I will or no.  And the King said: O
thou model of the Creator's cunning in the
making of man, thy hilarity is excused.  Food
thou shalt have, and water, and everything
else thou canst require, and that immediately.
But as for my daughter, there she is before
thee.  And she could teach dancing even to
Tumburu himself.[<a id="chap0302fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0302fn5">5</a>]

<p>
And then, as the laughter surged again in
Aja's soul, saying within himself: Out on this
pitiable old scarecrow of a King, whose only
thought is dancing! the King turned, and
stood aside.  And Aja looked, and instantly,
the laughter died out of his heart, which
ceased as it were to beat.  And he murmured
to himself: Ha! this is the most wonderful
thing of all.  King and women and desert and
all vanished out of his mind, as if the
sentiment that suddenly seized it filled it so
completely as to leave room for nothing else.  And
he stood still gazing, feeling as though he were
spinning round, though he was standing still as
death.  For there before him stood this
enigmatical King's daughter.  And like her father,
she also seemed an incarnation of the soul of
grief, not as in his case ignominious and an
object of derision, but rather resembling a
heavenly drug compounded of the camphor
of the cold and midnight moon, that had put on
a fragrant form of feminine and fairy beauty
to drive the world to sheer distraction, half
with love and half with woe.  For like the
silvery vision of the new-born streak of that
Lord of Herbs, she was slender and pale and
wan, formed as it seemed of some new strange
essence of pure clear ice and new dropt snow,
and she loomed on the soul of Aja out of the
blackness of his trance like a large white
drooping lily, just seen in the gloom of an inky
night.  And her hair and brow were the colour
of a thunder-cloud in the month of Chaitra,[<a id="chap0303fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0303fn1">1</a>]
and like that cloud, the heavy sorrow hung in
her great dark mournful eyes, drenching him
as it were with a shower of dusky dreamy dewy
beauty, and drawing him down bewitched and
lost like the victim of a haunted pool into the
snaky eddy of their silent unfathomable
recess.  And yet her deep red lips trembled, as
it were on the very border of a smile, as if
they were hinting against their will of a mine
of laughter and subtle snares that they were
not allowed to use.  And she had risen up to
come and meet him, yet was hanging back as
if reluctant, and so she stood, all reflected in
the polished floor, with her head thrown back
to look at him, for she was very small, like
one on the very point of imploring help, yet
shrinking, as if too proud to ask it from a
stranger, balanced as it were between reliance
on her own pure and pleading beauty and
doubtfulness of its reception.  So she halted
irresolute, with glorious throat that was
hovering still over the swell of her lifted breasts,
poised as it were on the very verge of tumultuous
oscillation, like that of Rati, preparing
with timidity to cast herself at the feet of the
three-eyed God, to beg back the body of her
burned-up husband in a passion of love-lorn
tears.
</p>

<p>
And Aja stood before her, like the sea when
the digit of the moon rises suddenly over its
waves, stirred with a tumult of strange
emotions, and yet lit by a heavenly ray, a mass of
agitated darkness mixed with dancing,
trembling light; all unaware that he was himself to
the King's daughter exactly what she was to
him, a weapon of bewilderment in the hands of
the cunning god of the flowery bow, who shot
him suddenly at her, like an arrow of intoxication,
and pierced her through the very middle
of the soft lotus of her heart.
</p>

<p>
So they two stood awhile in silence.  And
all at once, Aja spoke, not knowing that he
spoke aloud.  And he said, very slowly: How
many husbands, then, have already had this
lustrous beauty, who looks for all as pure
and pale and undefiled as a new young delicate
jasmine bud?  And instantly, as if roused
from sleep by his reproach, he saw the colour
leap up into her cheek, and spread like dawn
flushing over her burning throat and brow.
And she drew a sudden breath, and her bosom
heaved abruptly as if with a sob of shame.
And at that moment, the voice of the King
her father broke harshly into Aja's dream,
saying: Alas! alas!  Never a husband has had
her yet, though she is now long past sixteen,
and could even teach Tumburu dancing.
</p>

<p>
And then, as if the King's words had
suddenly lifted a weight from his soul, Aja burst
into a shout of laughter.  And he tottered, as
if to fall.  And he caught at the old King's
arm, and gripped it so that he almost
screamed, exclaiming amid his laughter: Ha!
King, I am also the son of a King: and now
I will be thy son-in-law.  And she shall have
a husband at last, and teach him, if she pleases,
dances that even Tumburu does not know.
And with that, he fell into such a paroxysm
of laughter, that weak as he was, he could not
stand, but fell: and his laughing turned to
sobbing.  Then the King's daughter turned
to her father, with an angry flush on her brow.
And she said, with strong emotion: O father,
wilt thou delay for ever to send for food and
water?  Dost thou not see that this King's
son, great and powerful though he be, is weak,
and it may be, perishing, before thy face, of
hunger and thirst, having escaped by a
miracle out of the desert to die by thy neglect?
</p>

<p>
And she clapped her hands, stamping her
foot in indignation.  Then the women ran,
and took up Aja, and carried him away.  And
they bathed him, and tended him, and fed him
till he was recovered: and after a while, they
brought him back, into the presence of the King.
</p>

</p>

<p>
So he came once more into that hall, looking
like another man.  And he seemed in the eyes
of the King like the rising sun of his
daughter's marriage, but in those of his daughter
like the very God of Love, newly risen from
his own ashes.  And he said joyously: O
King, now I am again myself: and my reason
and my strength have both again returned to
me.  And if in their absence, I behaved
strangely and without good manners, it
behoves thee to lay the blame rather on the
desert of sand that surrounds thy city, than on
myself.  For I was like one delirious, and half
distracted by wonder and other feelings
coming to the aid of hunger and thirst.  Then he
told the King his name and family, and all his
story, looking all the while at the King's
daughter, as she did all the while at him, with
glances that resembled sighs.  But as he
watched her, Aja said to himself in wonder:
What has happened to her, since I saw her
first, and what is the matter with her, now?
For her quiet grief has abandoned her, and
she looks like one in a burning fever; and two
red spots, like suns, burn and blaze upon her
cheeks, and her great eyes shine and glow, as
if there were a fire within her soul.  So when
he had finished his own tale, he said: Now,
then, O King, I have told thee all that I have
to tell.  And now it is thy turn to speak.
Explain to me all this wonder; for I seem to
move in a maze of extraordinary events.  Why
are there, in thy city, no men, but only women?
And what is the cause of thy grief?  And,
greatest wonder of all, how comes it that thou
hast found a difficulty in finding a husband
for this thy daughter?  For, as for myself,
know that, make any terms thou wilt, I am
ready to marry her, blindfold, on any
conditions whatever: nay, would she only be my
wife, I should consider the fruit of my birth
attained.
</p>

<p>
And then, to his amazement, that strange
old King began to weep once more.  And
tears flowed down his cheeks like rain, as he
said: Alas! alas!  O son-in-law that would be,
so fine a man art thou, that I am distressed
indeed to see thee, and to hear thee so eagerly
proposing to take my daughter for thy wife.
For all that have preceded thee, and they were
many hundreds, have said the very same: and
yet all without exception have come to a
miserable end: and there she is, unmarried still.[<a id="chap0304fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn1">1</a>]
And yet this is no fault of hers, unless indeed
it be a fault to be beautiful beyond compare.
Nor has her maiden purity been sullied in the
least degree by ever a suitor of them all.  But
all this has come about by reason of a fault
of mine, itself, beyond a doubt, the bitter fruit
of the tree of crimes committed in a former
birth.  For know that long ago, when I was
young, I conquered the entire earth, and
brought it all, from sea to sea, under the
shadow of one umbrella.  So when I was
reposing, after my exertions, one day there
came to see me Nárada and another <i>rishi</i>.
And Nárada entered first.  And when he
complimented me, as the chosen husband of
the earth, I said to myself: Now, I must make
him some suitable return.  And accordingly,
I presented him with the whole earth.  Then
he replied: O King, what is the use of the earth
to me?  And he gave it back to me, with his
blessing, saying: Obtain an incomparably
beautiful offspring![<a id="chap0304fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn2">2</a>] and so he went away.
And then the other great <i>rishi</i> entered, and
congratulated me also.  And I presented him
also with the entire earth.  Then that <i>rishi</i>
looked at me with eyes that were red with
anger.  And he said slowly: What!  Is my
merit utterly despised?  Dost thou presume
to offer me only the leavings of another?  Thou
shalt indeed obtain offspring, but only of the
female sex.  And beautiful it shall be indeed:
but little shall that beauty profit either thyself
or her.  So having uttered his curse,[<a id="chap0304fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn3">3</a>] he
laughed, and instantly went away, refusing to
be propitiated or to throw any light upon the
future.  And thereafter in due time there was
born to me, not the nectar of a son, but this
lump of grief in the form of a daughter.  And
as if her sex were not enough,[<a id="chap0304fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn4">4</a>] her almost
inconceivable beauty and accomplishments have
only added to my calamity: nay, they are the
very root of it, and the essence of its sting.
For all has come to pass, exactly as that testy
old <i>rishi</i> said.  For though she is, as thou
seest, beautiful as the moon, and like it, full of
arts,[<a id="chap0304fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn5">5</a>] and above all, a dancer that would turn
even Tumburu green with envy, all this nectar
has become poison by the curse of that old
ascetic, and the very perfection of her beauty
has become the means of undoing us both.
For about two years ago, as we were walking
together at midnight, on the terrace of the
palace, that forms the edge of the city wall,
enjoying the cold camphor of the moon after the
heat of a burning day, suddenly, out of the
desert, we heard as it were the rush of wings.
And as we stood and listened, there arose in
the air a sound of voices, like those of a man
and woman in vehement dispute.  But though
we could distinguish the tones, we could not
understand the meaning, for the language was
unknown to us.  And then, after a while,
those two invisible air-goers appeared all at
once before our eyes, seated on the
battlements, in the form of a pair of vultures.[<a id="chap0304fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn6">6</a>]
And immediately, the male vulture spoke with
a human voice, saying: O King, give me now
this daughter of thine to wife.  And instantly
I answered rashly: Never will I bestow my
daughter on a bird of ill-omen such as thou
art.  Thereupon that evil-minded suitor
laughed like a hyæna: and instantly my
daughter fell into a swoon.  And as she lay
in the moonlight, she looked so indescribably
and unutterably beautiful that even that
loathsome bird was moved.  And he said to his
companion: Daughter, I was right, and thou
wert wrong.  Look, and see, and allow, that
she is far more beautiful than even thou art.
Thereupon that <i>gridhri</i>[<a id="chap0304fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn7">7</a>] laughed also, and
she said: Time shall show.  Listen, King.
This is Kírttisena, a nephew of Wásuki, King
of the Snakes, and I am his only daughter.
For this form of vulture was assumed by us,
only to converse with thee.  Now he maintained
thy daughter to be more beautiful than
I am.  Thereupon I vowed vengeance.  But
I agreed to leave her unmolested, if thou didst
give her to him for a wife.  So to preserve her
from my vengeance, he asked her of thee in
marriage.  Now, then, since thou hast
rejected his suit, despising him hastily for his
outward form, and since my own beauty has
been slighted by his comparison, ye two shall
be punished, she for her beauty, and thou for
thine insolence, and through the means of that
very beauty, on account of which my father
and I have become contemptible.  See, O
thou who despisest a suitor, whether thou
canst easily procure another.  This shall be
the condition of thy daughter's marriage.
Whatever suitor shall lay claim to her, thou
shalt send up to this terrace alone at night.
And if he claims, and does not come, we will
swallow thy city whole, houses and all.  Then
those two vultures disappeared.  And not
long afterwards, hearing that my daughter
was to be given in marriage, suitors arrived
like swarms of bees from every quarter of the
world, attracted by her fame.  For she is
called Yashowatí, because the fame of her
fills the world.  Then all those suitors
followed one another, like the days of the year
in which they went, up upon the terrace of the
city wall: and like those days, not one of them
all has ever returned, but they have vanished
utterly, none knows how, or where.  And
when all the distant suitors were exhausted,
and all the neighbouring kings, then, in my
ardent desire to get her married, no matter
how, to no matter whom, I offered her to the
men of my own city, showing her to them
from the palace windows.  And every man
that saw her ran to win her; and one by one,
the men of the city followed after her former
suitors, till they grew few in the city.
Thereupon the women banded together, and took
their husbands and their sons and everything
in the shape of a man, and hid them: and now
as thou seest, there is not a man to be seen or
found, in the whole city.  But every stranger
that comes to the city, they catch, and bring
him straight to me, as they have done in thy
case also.  And the mere sight of my
daughter always makes him not only willing, but,
as thou art, even eager, to marry her at any
cost.  And yet they have all utterly vanished,
like stones dropped, one after another, into a
well without a floor.  And there is my
daughter, maiden and unmarried still.  And I can
see my ancestors wringing their hands for
grief: knowing well that as soon as I myself
am dead, it is all over with their race.  For
who will offer them water, since the fatal
beauty of my only daughter has set a term to
my ancient line?
</p>

<p>
So as Aja stood, lost in wonder at the old
King's story, his daughter suddenly rose to
her feet with a shrill cry.  And she exclaimed:
O son of a King, fly quickly!  Hence! away! back
with thee even into the desert, and leave
me and my father and this miserable city to
our inevitable fate.  And she sank down in a
swoon, and would have fallen to the ground,
but that Aja sprang quickly forward and
caught her as she fell.
</p>

<p>
So as he stood, holding her in his arms, and
wishing that her swoon might last for ever, so
only that he held her, for she stole away his
senses with the seduction of her fragrance and
proximity, her father exclaimed, in dismay:
Ha! this is something new, and a thing that
has never occurred before.  And what can be
the matter now?  O son of a King! she must
have fallen in love with thee, as well indeed she
might, for thy beauty and thy youth.  And
doubtless it has grieved her soul, to think of
thy approaching end.  But alas! alas! this is
worse than all.  For now, if thou fallest a
victim, as cannot fail to be the case, like all thy
predecessors, she will herself not survive thee:
and then, indeed, there is an end of all.  For
as long as she was left to be married, there was
still a shadow of hope behind.
</p>

<p>
And he began to ramble about, wringing
his hands for grief.  But Aja said to himself,
with joy: Ha! this was all I wanted, if only
it be true.  And he said to the King: O King,
it will be time enough to afflict thyself for her
death or for mine when we have actually died.
But count me, in the meantime, as thy son-in-law:
and be under no anxiety as to the fate of
thy ancestors.  For I will guarantee their good
condition: and this very night, I will rid thee
of the evil demon that molests her.  And
tomorrow, I will take this hand, and lead her
round the fire.[<a id="chap0304fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p>
And he took her hand, as she lay in his
arms, and touched it with his lips.
</p>

[<a href="#chap0304fn1text">1</a>] It may not be superfluous
to remind the English reader
that, according to Hindoo ideas,
there is no disgrace like that
of possessing an unmarried daughter.

female infants, to avoid it.

<p>
And instantly, as though his kiss had been
to her like sandal and like palm-leaf fans, she
came back to herself.  And when she saw who
held her, she started up, and stood, blushing
the colour of her own lips, with eyes cast upon
the ground.  And the King said: O daughter,
what is this?  Does it become a high caste
maiden outwardly to exhibit her inward feelings,
and abandon the straight line of virgin
modesty by behaviour that betrays her heart?
</p>

<p>
And then, Yashowatí sighed deeply.  And
she looked for a while in silence, first at her
father, and then at Aja: and all at once, she
stood erect, like one seized by sudden
resolution, and she clapped her hands together, and
exclaimed, in a voice that shook and quivered
with emotion: Ha! who can hide a forest fire
by covering it over with a little straw, or what
does maiden conduct matter, in the ruin of the
three worlds!  Aye! the fire of grief consumed
me, to see this noble son of a king, and to think
that he escaped the desert only to meet his
death from me.  Now has my punishment
come upon me in the form of this tall and
splendid youth.  For I grieved for the fate
of my former suitors, and yet I saw them
for all that go, one by one, to their useless
doom, and still myself remained alive.  Long
ago, beyond a doubt, I ought myself to have
left the body, and perished of my own accord,
rather than consent to live, the cause of death
to so many others: and by putting myself to
death, I should have cut in two the fatal chain
of their succession, and saved their lives by
the substitute of my own.  And now, instead,
I have been as it were their murderess, and a
death to them all in female form.  And now
the Deity has avenged them, by sending to
me at last the God of Love in human shape,
whose death will be a grief to me a hundred
fold more awful than any death I could have
died.  And I myself shall not survive him.
Then why waste time in chiding one who has
but one more day to live?  For as soon as
night arrives, he must go like the rest to meet
his doom: and certain it is, that I shall not
live to see the sun rise again without him.
</p>

<p>
And as she spoke, they gazed at her, astonished.
For she seemed like one that has burst
the bonds of all restraint, and thrown all
consideration to the eight quarters of the world.
But as soon as she stopped, the old King
uttered a doleful cry.  And he exclaimed:
Yashowatí, O daughter, what words are these?
Is it any fault of thine that thou art beautiful?
And wilt thou talk of abandoning the body?
Then what will become of the family, of which
thou art the only hope?  But Aja laughed:
and he said: O lovely lady, waste not thy grief
on such a thing as I am: and O father-in-law,
cease from bewailing calamities that are only
the shadows of thy own fears cast upon the
dark curtain of the future.  For many are
they that are doomed to die, yet never perish
after all.  And I have not escaped the sand
to perish lightly in any other way.  Be
assured that the lamp of thy race is burning still
with a steady flame, not to be extinguished by
a little puff of wind.  To-morrow we will
laugh together over these idle apprehensions,
which the rising sun will dissipate together
with the mists of night.
</p>

<p>
But Yashowatí turned, and looked at him
with steady eyes.  And she said: My husband,
for such indeed thou art, the first that I have
ever chosen,[<a id="chap0305fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn1">1</a>] and the last that shall ever claim
my hand: dost thou think that I would have
so far forgotten the reserve that is becoming
to a maiden of my caste, as to offer myself like
an <i>abhisáriká</i>, but that I know, as thou canst
not know it, the absolute and utterly inevitable
certainty of thy doom, and that this is the
very last day we shall spend together, though
it is also the very first?  And Aja looked at
her with affection: and he laughed again.
And he said: Sweet wife, since thou art so
very certain, then as it must be, let it be.  What
care I for to-morrow, if I am with thee all
to-day?  Knowing that but an hour ago, when
first I saw thee, I would have given my life,
doubly dear as it was by reason of its recent
escape from death, to win from thee a little
love, even a very little.  But as it is, a single
day is life enough, provided it is spent with
thee, even though I were really destined never
to see another.
</p>

<p>
And she looked at him with wistful eyes;
and after a while, she said: Thou art brave,
and as I would have had thee.  And thou dost
not believe me: and it may be, it is better so.
And then she turned to the King, and said:
O father, go away now: and leave me alone
with my husband.  And be not afraid, either
for thy honour or my own, for there shall be
as it were a sword between us.  But I wish to
have him all to myself, until the end.  And
when the time has come, let the gong be
sounded, and I will send him out to thee, and
thou canst show him the way to death.  And
thereupon the old King went away as she
desired, moaning and muttering, and
wringing his hands with grief.
</p>

<p>
So when he was gone, those two lovers sat
together all day long, gazing at each other
like the sunflower and the sun.  And he
utterly forgot the morrow, but it never left her
mind, even for a single instant.  And she
made him relate to her his whole life from the
very beginning, drinking in his words, and
hanging on his lips, and watching him keenly,
with eyes that never left his face, holding all
the while his hand, with the grasp of one who
knows that her husband must be led to
execution in the evening.  And she said to herself,
at every moment: Still he is here: still he is
here.  And when the sun set, she sent for food
and delicacies and wine, and fed him like a
child with her own hand, tasting herself
nothing.  And she surfeited him with the honey
of her sweetness and the syrup of her kisses
and the nectar of the young new moon of
beauty bathed in the sun of love, the redder[<a id="chap0305fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0305fn2">2</a>]
because of its approaching set.  And all at
once, she started to her feet, in the very middle
of a caress.  And she stood, listening.  And
Aja listened also: and he heard in the silence
the sound of a gong.
</p>

<p>
So as he watched her, she turned paler and
ever paler, like the east at the break of dawn.
And she put her two hands together, and
pressed them tight against her heart, and then
against her brow.  And all at once, she came
quickly to him, and said in a low voice: It is
time.  And she took his head in her hands,
and kissed him, with lips that were cold as ice,
and yet hot as fire, first on the eyes, and then
on the mouth, and last of all upon the brow.
And then she took his hand, and held it for
a little while, with a clutch that almost hurt
him, gazing at him with thirsty eyes.  And
suddenly, she threw away his hand, and pushed
him away roughly, saying: Go.  But Aja
caught her in his arms, and kissed her yet
again, as it were against her will.  And he
said: O fearful heart, be not afraid.  Very
soon, I will return.  And he went away
quickly, but at the door he turned, and saw
her standing still, watching him with dry bright
eyes, and lips that were shut tight.  And at
that very moment, the old King took him by
the arm, and said: Come now, and I will show
thee the way by which all thy predecessors
went before thee.
</p>

<p>
Then Aja said: O King, I am unarmed.
Give me a weapon to carry with me.  So the
King took him into the armoury, and he chose
for himself a sword almost as long as he was
tall.  But he threw away the scabbard,
saying: This would only be in the way: and now
I am prepared.  And then the King led him
away, and up a winding stair.
</p>

<p>
And when they were at the top, he stopped.
And he said: O son-in-law that might have
been, now fare thee well.  And even I feel it
harder to part with thee than with any of thy
predecessors.  Thou wouldst have made an
altogether appropriate husband for my
daughter, and O! that thou couldst have seen her
dance, before thus disappearing: but now it
is too late, for I doubt whether Tumburu
himself could make her dance to-night, so troubled
did she seem to be at bidding thee good-bye.
Go out, now, through yonder door: and thou
wilt be more fortunate than all the others, if
thou canst manage to return through it.
</p>

<p>
Then he went back into the palace.  But
Aja passed through the door, and found
himself on the city wall.

And he stood on the edge of the city wall,
with his naked sword in his hand.  And he
looked on this side and on that, and saw the
turrets of the city jutting out along the wall,
like the huge black heads of elephants of war
advancing in a line.  And behind him lay the
city, covered over with a pall of black that was
edged and touched with silver points and
fringes; and before him the desert stretched
away, smeared as it were with ashes, under the
light of the moon.  And brave as he was, his
heart beat, just a very little, in expectation
of what was coming.  And he said to himself:
My father-in-law's dismissal was not very
reassuring.  But where then is the danger, and
from what quarter is it coming, and what form
will it take?  For here is nothing whatever to
fight with, except the shadows cast by the
moon.  Or is this all merely a trick of the
King to test me, before which all my
predecessors have ignominiously failed?  Yet no.
For were it so, my wife would indeed be an
actress[<a id="chap0401fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0401fn1">1</a>] capable of reducing Tumburu to the
state of ashes.
</p>

<p>
So as he stood, waiting, and smiling at his
own thoughts, it happened that that daughter
of Kírttisena, whose jealousy of the King's
daughter had caused all the trouble in the
King's city, came according to her custom
flying towards the city wall.  For every night
she came to see whether there was a new suitor.
And whenever she discovered one, she had
recourse to a Rákshasa that was bound to her
by obligations, who came as soon as thought
of, and swallowed that unhappy suitor whole.[<a id="chap0401fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0401fn2">2</a>]
And now for some time, no new suitor had
appeared.  So as she came flying in the likeness
of a bat, she looked towards the city wall,
expecting to find it empty.  And she saw,
instead, Aja, standing, leaning on his sword,
and smiling, on the very edge of the wall.
And at the very first glance at him, she was
struck with stupor, and she fell that very
moment so violently in love with him[<a id="chap0401fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0401fn3">3</a>] that she
could hardly flap her wings, by reason of the
fierce agitation of her heart.  So she alighted
on the wall, a little distance off, and remained
watching him, hardly able to breathe for
emotion, in her own form[<a id="chap0401fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0401fn4">4</a>] but surrounding
herself with a veil of invisibility to escape his
observation.  And after a while, she drew a
long breath, and murmured to herself: Ha! this
is a suitor indeed, very different from all
the others; and rather than a mere mortal man,
he resembles the son of Dewakí,[<a id="chap0401fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0401fn5">5</a>] with Rádhá
caressing him in the form of the moonlight that
seems to cling affectionately to his glorious
limbs.  Ha!  he looks like the tutelary deity
of the city come to defy me, bringing the god
of love to his aid in the form of his own
marvellous and incomparable beauty.  Aye! and
I feel that I am defeated already, before the
battle has so much as begun.  And then, all
at once, a spasm of rage shot through her
heart, and she turned pale.  And she
exclaimed: Ah! but I am anticipated by this
accursed King's daughter, who will rob me of
him, nay, has already done it, by her undeniable
hateful beauty, and her priority of claim.
Alas! alas!  O why did I not see him first, before
her abominable loveliness had made an
impression on his heart?  For he is very young, and
it must be, open to the spell of beauty, and
artless, and sincere.  Ha!  And suddenly, she
started up, as if an idea had rushed into her
mind.  And she stood for a moment, thinking.
And then she exclaimed, with a gesture of
resolution: Yes, I also am beautiful.  Now,
then, I will efface her image from his heart,
and replace it by my own.  Now I will assault
him, by all the power of my charms,[<a id="chap0401fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0401fn6">6</a>] and we
will see whether he will be proof against the
glamour of a beauty such as mine, multiplied
and magnified by magic sorcery and fierce
determination.  Aye!  I will move heaven and
earth to steal his heart from the King's
daughter, and turn Pátála[<a id="chap0401fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0401fn7">7</a>] upside down to make
him mine instead of hers.  But if I fail?  And
again she turned deadly pale.  And after a
while, a bitter smile curled over her lips.  And
she said: If, if I fail; no, but I will not fail.
But if I fail, then, I will take another way.

<p>
So as Aja stood upon the wall, looking out
over the desert, suddenly all vanished from
before his eyes.  And he saw before him no city,
and no desert.  But he found himself in a
dusky wood, thick with tall <i>tamála</i>[<a id="chap0402fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0402fn1">1</a>] trees, and
lit by a light that was neither that of the sun
nor that of the moon.  And all around him
huge red poppies waved gently without a
wind, mixed with great moon-lotuses, whose
perfume went and came by turns as it hung
on the heavy air.  And under the shadow of
the black-leaved trees large bats flew here and
there with slow and noiseless flap, and on the
branches monstrous owls with topaz eyes like
wheels of flame sat motionless, as if to watch.
And a dead silence like that of space whence
all three worlds have been removed left Aja
nothing else to hear but the beat of his own
heart.  And the hair rose up upon his head
with sheer amazement.  And he said to
himself: Ha! what new wonder is this, and what
has become of the city wall?  And where in the
world have I got to now, and how?  Now let
me be very wary, for the danger is evidently
coming near.
</p>

<p>
And as he stood, grasping his sword,
prepared, and looking quickly right and left,
suddenly he saw a thing which rivetted his gaze
to it, as if with an iron nail.
</p>

<p>
A little way off, among the poppies, was
standing up like a lonely column all that was
left of one of the walls of a ruined temple,
whose fallen pillars were lying scattered all
around it, half concealed by creeping leaves.
And as he gazed intently at this upright
fragment of a fallen wall, he saw upon it the image
of a sculptured woman, which stood out so
distinctly that he could not take his eyes from
it.  And after a while, he said to himself:
Surely that can be no stone statue, but a real
woman of flesh and blood, actually leaning,
who knows why, against that bit of a broken
wall.  And he looked and looked, and after a
while, filled with irresistible curiosity, he went
nearer, but very slowly, and as it were on his
guard, to see.
</p>

<p>
So as he gazed, wonder and admiration
gradually crept into his soul, and stole his
recollection unaware.  And he became wholly
intent on the stone image, and forgetful of his
situation.  And he ceased to wonder at
finding himself in the wood, so great was his new
wonder at the beauty of the woman on the
wall.  And he said to himself: Surely he was
a master artist, whoever he was, that made this
woman out of stone, if stone indeed she be.
For even now, near as I am, I can hardly
believe she is made of stone.
</p>

<p>
And the more he looked, the more he
marvelled.  For she seemed in his eyes like a
frozen mass of lunar camphor, moulded into
a female form, standing cold and pure and
still, alone by herself in that strange half light,
that hovered as it were irresolute between the
natures of night and day.  And she stood with
her right hand on her hip, which jutted out to
receive it like the curve of a breaking wave:
and her bare right breast stood out and shone
like a great moonlit sea pearl, while the other
was hiding behind the curling fold of the pale
green garment that ran around her, embracing
her with clinging clasp like a winding wisp of
emerald foam fondly wrapping the yielding
waist of Wishnu's sea-born wife.  And she
was very tall, and shaped like Shrí, and she
stood with her head a little bent, and her
sightless eyes fixed as it were on empty space, just
as though she were listening for some expected
sound.  And as he continued to gaze at her,
a wonder that was almost horror crept into his
mind.  For her face was not like that of an
image, but rather resembled a mask, or the
face of a very beautiful woman, that very
moment dead.  For the colour seemed as it
were to have only just faded from her cheek,
and the blood seemed only just before to have
left her pallid lips, and the sight was as it
were hanging yet in her great long open eyes,
that were fixed on the distant sky.  And he
stood, gazing, as if the very sight of her had
made of him another image like herself.
</p>

<p>
And then, at last, he stepped forward.  And
he put out his left hand, and touched her with
his forefinger on the shoulder that was bare.
</p>

<p>
And instantly, as if his touch had filled her
with a flood of life, a shiver ran like quicksilver
over her stony limbs.  And as he started back,
to watch, the colour came back into her face,
and red blood rushed into her lips, and deep
blue suddenly filled her eyes.  And the tresses
of hair around her head turned all of a
sudden a glossy black, that shone with a
blue-green lustre, as if reflecting the grassy sheen
of her winding robe.  And her bosom lifted
slowly, and fell again with a deep sigh.  And
all at once, she abruptly altered her position,
and her eyes fell straight on Aja, standing
just before her.  And she lifted up, first one
eyebrow, and then the other, till they formed
a perfect bow, for they joined each other in
the middle.  And she uttered a faint cry, as if
in joy, exclaiming: Ha! can it be, and is it
thou?  Or am I dreaming still?

<p class="t3b">

</p>

<p>
And Aja stood, staring at her with stony
gaze, like a mirror of her own surprise.  And
he said to himself: Surely it is not she, but I
myself, that am the dreamer.  For here since
the sun rose last, I have escaped the desert,
and found this city without a man, and
acquired a bride of peerless beauty: and now
here is another, rising as it were from the dead,
and seeming to expect me.  And he continued
standing silent, gazing at her, sword in hand.
And after a while, she said: What! is my form,
then, so frightful as to rob thee of thy tongue?
Or art thou going to use that sword against
me?  Speak: but in the meanwhile, let me
see whether I have lost the use of my limbs,
as thou hast that of thy tongue, after so long
a sleep.  And she leaped from her little
pedestal, and moved a little way here and there,
waving her beautiful arms about: and after
a while, she came back, and sat down just
before him, on one of the fallen pillars that were
lying about the ground.  And all the while
Aja watched her, as if fascinated by a serpent,
saying within himself: She moves like
nothing I ever saw, save a panther or a gliding
snake.[<a id="chap0403fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn1">1</a>]  And then, all at once, she again put
up one eyebrow, and said to him with a smile:
Must I, then, actually tell thee, that I am
Natabhrúkutí?[<a id="chap0403fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0403fn2">2</a>]  Then Aja said: O lady, it
is obvious.  For thy bent brow would plant
arrows even in the heart of the Great Ascetic.
And she said again: O husband, is this thy
welcome, after so long a separation?
</p>

<p>
And Aja bounded, as if bitten by a snake.
And he exclaimed: Thy husband!  What!
Am I then thy husband also?  Does thy whole
sex want to get me for a husband?  But O
thou beauty of bending brows, how can he be
thy husband, that never saw thee in his life
before?  And only this morning, I was still
wifeless, and a day has not elapsed, since I
became another's husband.  And he stopped
short, again confounded at the effect of his
own words.  For hardly had they passed his
lips, when Natabhrúkutí started up, swelling
with rage and convulsed with fury, with eyes
that blazed like fiery stars.  And she
exclaimed: Never! never!  Never shall she
possess thee, nor any other than I myself.  And
then, like a flash of lightning, her rage
vanished as quickly as it came.  And she looked
at him with imploring eyes, and said: Slay
me now, with thy long bright sword, and send
me back to that nonentity out of which thou
hast just recalled me: but speak not of
another woman in front of me.  Alas! and am
I all forgotten?  And tears rolled from her
great blue eyes, and fell like suppliants at her
feet.
</p>

<p>
And Aja put up his left hand, and tugged
at his hair in the extremity of his amazement.
And he said: O thou strange offended lady,
I am utterly bewildered, and resemble one
that has lost his way at midnight in a wood.
And thy anger and thy grief are alike
altogether incomprehensible.  How can I possibly
have forgotten one, whom as I just now told
thee, I never saw in my life before?  Then she
said: Nay, not in this life, but the last.  For
I was the wife of thy former birth.
</p>

<p>
Then Aja laughed, and he said: O beauty,
who remembers his former birth?  For like
every other man, and like my ancestor the
sun, I have risen up into light out of the sea
of dark oblivion, into which I must sink again
at last.  And then she looked at him with a
deep sigh.  And she said: Alas!  This is a
punishment indeed, and worse by far than all
the rest, if after having endured so long the
state of a stone upon a wall, I am again
become a woman, only to find myself repudiated
and all forgotten, by him, on whose account I
suffered all.  Listen, then, and I will tell thee
the story of thy former birth.  It may be
that, in the hearing, some scattered reminiscences
will be as it were awakened, to stir
again in the dark lethargy of thy sleeping soul.

<p>
And then she began to speak.  And as she
spoke, she leaned forward, as she sat upon the
fallen pillar, and fastened her great eager eyes
like magnets on his own.  And as Aja watched
them, they played as it were upon his heart.
For their colour wavered and changed and
faltered, shifting ever from hue to hue,
turning golden and ruddy amber, and emerald-green
and lotus-blue; and over her eyes her
arching brows lifted and fell and played and
flickered, fixing his troubled soul like nails, and
rivetting his attention, till her singing voice
sounded in his head like a distant tune crooned
in the ear of a sleepy man.  And she waved
slowly her long round arms, all the while she
spoke.  And she said: Far away, over the sea,
lies thy own forgotten land, and presently I
will tell thee, and even show thee, where it is.
And there it was, in our former birth, that
thou and I were boy and girl.  But thou wert
the son of a mighty King, and I was only a
Brahmani, a poor man's daughter, and my
father was an old ascetic, far below thee in
everything else but caste.  And I lived alone
with my old father, in the very heart of a great
forest, in a little hut of bark, over which the
<i>málati</i> creeper grew so thick that nothing was
visible of that little hut, except its door.  And
then one day I was seen by thee, standing still
in that very door, with my pitcher on my head:
as thou wert passing through the wood to
hunt upon thy horse.  And that moment was
like a sponge, that blotted from the mind of
each everything but the other's image.  And
I made of thee my deity, and forgot everything
in the three great worlds, for thee alone.  And
thou, that day, didst clean forget thy hunting:
or rather, the God of Love showed thee game
of another kind,[<a id="chap0404fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0404fn1">1</a>] and from pursuing thou
didst fall to wooing a quarry that wished for
nothing so much as to be thy prey.  And we
married each other that very day, which
ah! thou hast all forgotten.  What! dost thou not
remember how I used to meet thee every day
in the little hut, when my father was away in
the wood engaged in meditation?  What! hast
thou really all forgotten how it was thy
supreme delight to bring me garments and
costly jewels, which I put on for thy amusement,
thy forest-queen of the little hut?  Has
thy memory cast away every vestige of
reminiscence of thy old sweet love in the little
hut?  So then it happened that on a day we
were together, blind and drunk with each
other's presence, shut within the little hut like
a pair of bees in a nectared lotus.  And I was
standing like an idol, dressed like the queen of
a <i>chakrawarti</i>,[<a id="chap0404fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0404fn2">2</a>] loaded with gold on wrists and
feet, with great pearls wound about my neck;
and thou wert contemplating me, thy
creature,[<a id="chap0404fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0404fn3">3</a>] with intoxication, and hard indeed it
was to tell which of us two was the idol, and
which was the devotee.  And as we woke up
from a kiss that lasted like infinity, lo! my
father stood before us.  And he said slowly:
Abandoned daughter, that hast forgot thy
duty in thy passion for this King's son,
become what thou hast represented, an idol[<a id="chap0404fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0404fn4">4</a>] of
stone on the wall of a ruined temple far away:
and thou, her guilty lover, fall again into
another birth, and be separated from thy guilty
love.  Then being besought by us, to fix some
period to the curse, he said again: When ye
two shall meet again, and thy husband in his
curiosity shall touch thee with his finger, she
shall regain her woman's state, and be as she
was before.  And now all this has come about,
exactly as he said.  And I have found thee
once again, only to find alas! alas! that thou
hast left thy heart behind thee in that old

<p>
So as he listened, Aja's soul was filled as it
were with a mingled essence of wonder and
irresolution and sheeny beauty and singing
sound.  For the tone of her voice was like a
lute, and before his eyes hovered a picture of
waving arms and witching curves, out of which
her dreamy eyes, from which he could not take
his own, seemed as it were to speak to him of
love reproachful and old regret.  And all at
once, with a violent effort, he roused himself
as if from sleep with open eyes.  And he
shifted his sword to the other hand, and passed
his right across his brow.  And he said, in
some confusion: O thou strange and sweet-tongued
woman, certain this much is, that I
am filled by thee with emotion that I do not
understand.  And yet I know not what to
think, or even say.  For even apart from the
promptings of a former birth, thy beauty and
thy haunting voice, which I seem as it were to
have heard before, are quite sufficient to rouse
emotion even in a stone, much more in a man
of flesh and blood.
</p>

<p>
Then she shook her head sadly, looking at
him with glistening eyes; and she said, with a
smile of ineffable sweetness: Ah! this is as I
thought, and the instinct of thy former birth
is clouded over and effaced, by thy meeting
with this other woman in the morning of this
very day.  Alas! how small, how very small,
the interval of space and time that divides the
paradise of joy from the dungeon of despair!
For had this our reunion been sooner by only
a single day, I should have caught thy heart
before it had been occupied by this all too
fortunate other woman, who now holds it like a
fortress, garrisoned by a prior claim.  But
what is this priority of claim?  Can she, who
by thine own confession has known thee only a
single day, dare to dispute priority with the
darling of thy former birth?[<a id="chap0405fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0405fn1">1</a>]  Wilt thou
break thy faith with me, to keep thy faith with
her?  Aye! and wilt thou, after all, gain so
much by the exchange?  Is she beautiful, then,
this other woman?  But I am beautiful, too?
And she stood up, and looked at Aja with her
head thrown back and proud eyes, as though
to challenge his condemnation of her own
consummate beauty.  And she said again: Is she,
then, this other beauty, either more faithful or
more beautiful than I am?  Speak, and tell me
if thou canst, in what I am inferior, or why I
am to be despised, in comparison with her.
</p>

<p>
And Aja looked at her again, and felt
abashed, and half ashamed, he knew not why.
And he murmured to himself: She does not
lie: for beautiful she is indeed, and need not
fear comparison with any woman in the world.
And it may be, she is partly right, and if I had
met her yesterday, before my heart was full,
she would have had little difficulty in entering
in and capturing it, almost without resistance.
And he stood looking at her silently, uncertain
what to say or do, and half inclined to pity
her, and half afraid of her and of himself,
admiring her against his will, and as it were
confessing by his very silence the power of her
appeal.  For notwithstanding the preoccupation
of his heart, his youth and his sex became
as it were allies with her against his resolution,
compelling him to acknowledge the supremacy
of the cunning god, and the spell of
feminine attraction incarnate in her form.
</p>

<p>
And she stood there before him, for a little,
with beauty as it were heightened by resentful
reproach of the slighting of itself, and the
disregard of its tried affection.  And then all at
once she sank down upon the ground, as if
she were tired, and remained sitting among the
poppies, with her chin resting on her left knee,
which she embraced with her arms, watching
him, and as it were, waiting with humility and
patience for a decision in her case.  And every
now and then, she closed her eyes, and opened
them again, as if to make sure that he was
there.
</p>

<p>
And Aja looked round in the silence, at the
poppies and the lotuses, and the great owls
that seemed to watch him, and back again at
her.  And his head began to whirl, and he
muttered to himself: Is this a dream, and what
does it all mean?  And is she returning to the
condition of an image, disgusted by my
coldness and disdain?  And what is to be done?
And he looked at her face, deprived, by the
closing of their lids, of the moon of her eyes,
and resting like a mask upon its chin.  And
he said within himself: Her eyebrows move,
as if they were alive.  And he felt as it were
unable to look away from them: and at last,
annoyed with himself, he closed his eyes also,
as though to escape their persecution.

</p>

<p>
And then, he said to himself: This is cowardice,
and after all, no refuge; for I seem to see
her still, through the shutters of my lids.  And
he opened his eyes once more.  And instantly,
he leaped from the ground like a wounded
stag, with a cry.  For the wood, with all its
lotuses and poppies, was gone.  And in its
place, he saw before him a forest with its great
green trees all lit by the shining of the sun.
And just in front of him there stood a little
hut, buried in the blossom of the <i>málati</i>
creeper.  And in its doorway was standing a
young Brahman woman, with a pitcher on her
head.  And she beckoned to him with a smile,
and he looked, and lo!  it was Natabhrúkutí.
Then moved as if against his will, on feet that
carried him towards her as it were of their
own accord, he approached her.  And as he
drew nearer, there came from that creeper a
wave of perfume, resembling that of jasmine,
but sweeter, and so pungent that it entered
like fire into his soul.  And then she lifted the
pitcher from her head, and set it down upon
the ground, and caught him by the hand, and
drew him within the hut.  And there she cast
herself into his arms, whispering in his ear,
very low, so as to caress it as she spoke with
her lips: My father is away, and now we are
alone, and the day is all before us.  Come now,
what shall I do for thy delight?  And she ran
and shut the door; and then, taking from a
chest rich clothes and splendid jewels, she
began to put them on, saying as she did so:
See! am I becoming more fit to be thy queen?  And
he watched her, stupefied, like one in a dream,
and all the while she bathed him with intoxicating
side glances shot like arrows from the bow
of her arching brows.  And at last, she came
slowly towards him, walking on tip-toe, and
attitudinising, placing herself exactly in the
posture in which he had seen her first among
the poppies on the wall, with one hand on her
hip.  And she said, lifting her brow, with a
smile that stole his reason: Now, then, the idol
is ready for the devotee.  And at that
moment the door opened, and an old Brahman
entered through it.  And he said slowly:
Abandoned daughter, that hast forgot thy
duty in thy passion for this King's son,
become what thou hast represented, an idol of
stone on the wall of a ruined temple far away;
and thou her guilty lover, fall into another
birth, and be separated from thy guilty love.
</p>

<p>
And then, Aja heard no more.  The world
whirled around him; the blackness of night
closed over his soul; he uttered a terrible cry,
and fell to the ground in a swoon.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0407"></a></p>

<p class="t3b">
VII
</p>

<p>
And when he came to himself, he was back
again among the poppies in the <i>tamála</i> wood.
And he was lying on the ground, with
Natabhrúkutí bending over him, holding him by the
hand, with anxiety in her eyes.  And instantly
he started up, and seizing his sword, stood
gazing at her with stupefaction.  And he said to
himself: Am I dead or dreaming?  And what
does it all mean?  Is it a delusion of the
Creator, or a mirage and a madness of the desert,
out of which I have never yet escaped at all?
Aye! beyond a doubt, I am wandering still in
the waste of sand, raving mad, and dying, and
haunted by phantoms that are the premonitors
of approaching death.
</p>

<p>
So as he stood, balancing in the swing of
perplexity, and doubting his own reason,
Natabhrúkutí looked at him fixedly, with
concern and affection and curiosity in her eyes.
And she said: Surely thou art ill.  And why
then dost thou shrink from me, as though I
were a thing of terror: I, who ask for nothing
but to tend thee all my life?  For it was but
now, as we spoke together in this wood, I
looked up and saw thee suddenly close thy
eyes.  And as I watched thee, wondering to
see thee sleeping as it were erect, there burst
from thy lips a fearful cry, and I had but time
to catch thee falling, and let thee sink upon
the ground.  And I brought thee to thyself,
by fanning thee, as well as I might, with this
great leaf.
</p>

<p>
And she held it up before him, while he
continued to gaze at her in silence.  And as he
did not speak, she looked at him curiously, and
muttered under her breath, as though speaking
to herself, and not intending him to hear: Can
he have suddenly recollected his former birth,
and is this the reason why he is staring at me,
as if wishing to compare me with a picture in
his head?  And as he still kept silence,
presently she said aloud: Dear, thou art sick: and
much in need of medicines, such as I alone can
give thee.  Why wilt thou not confide in me?
For I am a cunning leech, and know the
virtue of every herb and every vegetable drug
better than Dhanwantari[<a id="chap0407fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0407fn1">1</a>] himself.  And I
have made myself mistress of every species of
the art of healing, and in particular, I have fed
myself on perfumes, and on the essences of
flowers, and all the scented odours of aromatic
shrubs, till I have myself become as it were a
very attar, incarnate in a woman's form.  Dost
thou doubt it, and think me to be boasting? then
try me, and I will prove to thee my
power by experiment, in any way thou wilt.
I will soothe and shampoo[<a id="chap0407fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0407fn2">2</a>] thee with a hand
softer than a snowflake's fall and cooler than
the icy moon: or, if thou wilt, I will croon to
thee old airs, and put thee to sleep like a tired
child, resting thy head on this bosom which
once was thy delight, with melodies that shall
speak to thee of drowzy bees and moaning
winds: or I will steal thy waking senses from
thee and lure them into slumber as it were
against thy will by snaring them with
fragrances more luscious than that <i>párijáta</i>
blossom, which Wishnu once trailed through the
intoxicated world, to drive it into madness at
the moment, and leave it filled with inconsolable
regret when it was gone.  See, take this,
and smell it, and thou wilt be better even now.
And she held out towards him, in the lotus
of her hand, a tiny flower, in colour like an
atom of the concentrated essence of the sky.
And as Aja looked at it, there came from it a
stream of a sharp and biting scent, that rushed
into his soul, coming laden as it were with
reminiscence and suggestions of the past; so
that he said to himself: Ha! of what does this
remind me, and where is it that I smelled its
almost intolerable sweet before?  And
suddenly, the little hut rushed into his mind, and
he exclaimed: It is the very smell of the creeper
on its roof.  And instantly, a feeling of
amazement that almost overcame him, mingled
with terror, crept like a shudder over his limbs,
and his hair stood on end.  And he looked at
Natabhrúkutí, who was watching him intently,
and said, hoarsely: Who art thou, thou strange
beauty, and what dost thou want of me?  And
what is the meaning of these inexplicable
mysteries, before which I feel as if my reason were
deserting me, and I were about to faint again?

<p>
Then she laughed, and said: Fair boy, I
am only that bitter-sweet,[<a id="chap0408fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0408fn1">1</a>] a woman: and I
want no more than what every woman wants,
the man she loves, and that is thou.  Aye! dost
thou ask me, who and what I am?  Listen
then, and I will tell thee.  I am a bee, which
not like other bees roams roving to flower
after flower, but confines itself exclusively to
one.  I am a breeze, which not like other
breezes blows fickle and inconstant now hither
and now thither, but is fixed and ever steady,
coming straight from Malaya laden with the
sandal of affection to lay it at thy feet.  I am
only the echo of a voice which is thyself, the
shadow of a substance and the reflection of a
sun.  I am like the other half of the god that
carries the moon upon his head, the twin, the
duplicate and counterpart of a deity who is
thou.  I am Rati, rejoicing to find again the
body of her husband, and thou art Love
himself returned to life whom I have found.  I
am an essence of the ocean, but unlike it, I
hold within my heart not many pearls, but
only one, which is thyself.  I am a wick,
consuming in thy flame, and like the music of a
lute, I am a thing wholly compounded of
melodies and tones, whose mood and being are
dependent on the player, who is thou.  Art
thou sad? then I am also: art thou joyous? so
am I: my soul is tossed about, and hangs on
thy smiling or thy sighing, as a criminal
depends on the sentence of the judge.  And like
a crystal, I am colourless[<a id="chap0408fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0408fn2">2</a>] without thee, but
ready on the instant to assume every tinge of
the colour of thyself.  Cast thy eyes upon
me, and thou shalt see as in a glass thy every
mood painted on the surface of my face.
Ah! dost thou ask me what I am?  Alas!  I am a
target for the poisoned arrows which Love
shoots at me in the form of thy beauty greater
than his own.  And I am like a bare and
withered, leafless and frost-bitten tree, which has
suddenly shot up into blossom at the coming
of spring in thy form.  But as for thee, why,
O why dost thou regard me that live for only
thee as if I were a deadly snake, and thou a
startled deer?  In vain, in vain, dost thou
endeavour to repel me, for I will not be repelled.
I will melt thy cold ice in thy despite, by the
fire of my affection, and drown thee in its
flood, and sweep thee away from the rocks of
thy resistance till thou art lost for ever in its
dark and pearly depths.
</p>

<p>
And as Aja stood, listening in confusion to
her words, which poured from her like a
torrent, suddenly she clapped her hands, and
exclaimed, as he started again at her vehemence:
Ha! shall I tell thee, thou wilful and reluctant
boy, of what thou dost remind me, standing as
it were aghast, and obstinately set against me,
mute, and yet asking what I am?  Know, that
long ago there was a king, who had for wives
a thousand queens.  And it happened that
one day, he went with his wives to ramble in
the heart of a forest.  So after sporting for a
while, he grew tired, in the heat of the day, and
lay down and fell asleep.  Then all his queens
stole away and left him lying, and went
roaming up and down, very strange creatures
in that wild rough wood, looking like living
flowers of every hue and kind, that had
somehow or other got free from their roots, a body
of deer-eyed decoys let loose by Love the
Hunter, to lure into his toils every man that
should behold them.  So as they rambled here
and there, they came suddenly on an old
ascetic.  And he was standing still, half buried
in the hills of ants, themselves covered over
by his long white hair, immersed in meditation.
Then all those fair women went up and stood
around him in a cluster of beautiful curiosity,
wondering at the sight of him, and asking
each other in amazement, what in the world he
could possibly be.  So as they crowded round
him, that old ascetic emerged from his trance,
and as thou art doing, stood silent and aghast,
thinking, as perhaps thou dost thyself, that
Indra must have sent him all the nymphs of
heaven in a body, to lure him from the path of
liberation.  For, O, thou beautiful suspicious
youth, what is there so terrible about me, as
to cause thee to shrink from my approach?
Know, that many would be glad to be wooed
as was that old ascetic, and as thou art now.

</p>

<p>
And then, Aja strove to awake as it were
from a dream.  And he shook himself, as if
to shake it off, and he said to himself: I feel
that I am falling as it were a victim to the
spell of this passionate and subtle beauty; and
now, unless I stiffen and steel myself against
her, I shall undoubtedly be bewitched and
beguiled beyond the possibility of escape.  And
he summoned his resolution, and said, with a
semblance of composure: Fair one, thou dost
thyself no injustice in comparing thyself alone
to a thousand queens: for thou art a very
incarnation of all the bewildering fascination of
thy sex.  And yet, potent as they are, thy
charms are wasted, and resemble blunted
arrows when directed against me.  For as I
have already told thee, I am pledged to
another, and proof against thy spell, as doubtless
was thy old ascetic against that bevy of
straying queens.
</p>

<p>
And then Natabhrúkutí smiled, and she
shook at him her finger, as she answered:
Rash boy, beware!  Be not too sure of the
adamantine quality of thy resistance, nor even
of thy wisdom in resisting me at all.  And
beware of provoking the indignation of slighted
Love, who may make of thee a signal example
of his vengeance.  Take care, lest annoyed
with thy obstinacy in rejecting what he offers
thee for nothing, he should deprive thee even
of that other beauty, on whose account alone
it is that I am held by thee so cheap.  Poor
youth! but that my lips are tied, I could
enlighten thee.  Art thou, who art so ready
lightly to disdain me, art thou, I say, so sure,
so very sure, that thou art thyself the only
lover of this much married beauty, whom thou
sawest, as thou sayest, for the very first time
in thy life to-day?  Art thou so sure, so very
sure, that she is not deceiving thee, and that
thou art not merely the last of the many
lovers whom she toys with for a moment, and
then carelessly casts away?  Art thou so very
certain that thou hast never had a predecessor?
And Aja started, in spite of himself.  For the
word recalled to him the manner of the old
King.  And Natabhrúkutí saw it.  And she
looked at him as it were with compassion, and
said: Alas, unhappy boy: thou seest that in
thy youth and inexperience such an idea had
not occurred to thee.  Little art thou
qualified to cope with a woman's guile.
</p>

<p>
Then said Aja fiercely, in wrath both with
himself and her: It is false, and she is true.
But Natabhrúkutí answered very gently: Be
not angry, for I do not question that she loves
thee.  I do not even doubt it: for if she did
not, she would be a fool.  But listen, and
learn, what thou dost not seem to know, that
Love is a Master Knave; aye! by far the
greatest master of deceit in the three great worlds.
And woman is his aptest pupil, and every
woman living, were she even as simple as
thyself, becomes, as soon as she falls under the
influence of Love, a very incarnation of policy
and craft and wiles.  I tell thee, foolish boy,
that she that loves in earnest, were she good
as gold, pure as snow, and flawless as a
diamond, would plunge, to gain her object, to
the very lowest bottom of the ocean of deceit.
And what is her object but the esteem of her
lover?  Dost thou think she would balance for
an instant, between her lover and the ruin of
the world? between his good opinion, and a
lie?  Dost thou think she would forfeit thy
esteem, when to deceive thee would preserve
it?  I tell thee, in such a dilemma, she would
lie, till the very sun at noon hid his face out of
shame.  Know,[<a id="chap0409fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn1">1</a>] that long ago there lived at
Wáránasi[<a id="chap0409fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn2">2</a>] an independent lady, of beauty
so extraordinary, that swarms of lovers used
to buzz continually about her like great black
bees about the mango blossom in the spring.
But independent though she was, she was so
fastidious, that none of her innumerable lovers
ever touched her heart even for a moment.
And hence she lived like a lamp at midnight
surrounded by the corpses of her victims, who
fluttered about her lustre and perished in its
flame.  And then at last, one day it came
about that a tall young Rajpoot almost as
beautiful as thou art arrived at Wáránasí.
And Kasháyiní[<a id="chap0409fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn3">3</a>] (for that was her name) saw
him from a window as he came into the city;
and instantly like an empty pitcher suddenly
plunged into the Ganges, she was filled to
the very brim by the inrush of Love's sacred
nectar.  And she said to herself: The very
first thing that he will hear of in the city is
myself.  And like everybody else, he will
come immediately to see me: and that very
moment, I shall abandon the body out of
shame.  For though my beauty might attract
him, yet he will be convinced that many lovers
have preceded him, and therefore, at the
bottom of his heart he will despise me.  And this
would be worse than any death.  And yet
without him, my birth will have been in vain.
Therefore, I must devise some expedient.  So
after a while, she went out in disguise, and
bought for a large sum of money the body of
a woman of her own age and size who had died
that very day.  And bringing that body home
secretly at night, she dressed it in her own
clothes, and burned it till its identity was
obliterated.  And then she set fire to her house,
and left it by a back door, and went away,
abandoning all her wealth but the jewels that
she wore, for the sake of her picture in the
air.[<a id="chap0409fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn4">4</a>]  And at that very moment, the Rajpoot
came along, led by some of the townspeople
to visit her, as it were set on fire by the very
description of her beauty.  And he looked
and saw the flames bursting from her house,
as though lit by himself.  And they found the
half burned body in the ashes, and immediately
all the lovers of Kasháyiní followed her
through the fire of grief to the other world.
But the Rajpoot managed, in spite of
disappointment, to remain alive.  And she, in the
meantime, having given every one the slip,
found a false ascetic, and bribed him with
jewels, giving him instructions without letting
him know who she was.  So that ascetic went
and struck up acquaintance with the Rajpoot,
pretending to be a discoverer of treasure.[<a id="chap0409fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn5">5</a>]
And he performed incantations, and, after a
while, he said to him: Go quickly to Ujjayini,
and dig in the north-east corner of the
burning ground outside the city on the very last
day of the dark half of the month of Magha,
and thou shalt find a treasure.  Take it, for
what is the use of treasure to such a one as me.
Thereupon that Rajpoot, having nothing else
to do, went.  And Kasháyiní, having first made
sure that the bait had taken, went herself
and got there before him.  So when that
Rajpoot arrived, he dug exactly as he was told,
and found absolutely nothing.  And cursing
his destiny, he went out of the burning ground
in the early morning: and as he went along,
suddenly he saw Kasháyiní, who was
waiting for him, sitting weeping by the wayside,
under a great <i>ashwattha</i> tree: beautifully
dressed, blazing with jewels, and adorned with
saffron and antimony, betel, indigo, and
spangles, flowers, minium, and henna, bangles on
ankle and comb in her hair.  And she said to
that Rajpoot, who was as utterly astounded
by the sight of her as if she had been water in
the desert: O son of a king, succour one who
is utterly without resource.  And when he
asked her, what was the matter, she said: I
was the only wife of a very rich merchant, and
as we travelled from the South, suddenly we
were set upon by a band of Thags.  And
after killing every one but me,[<a id="chap0409fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0409fn6">6</a>] they all went to
sleep, thinking me secure; but in the middle of
the night, I went a little way, and hid myself
in a hollow tree.  And in the morning those
villains, after hunting for me in vain, all went
away, fearing a pursuit, and I came out of the
tree trembling, and reached this road, and now
I am alone in the world.  Then said the
Rajpoot to himself: Ha! so, after all, I have found
my treasure, and that excellent ascetic was a
true prophet.  And he said: O lady, I am of
good family.  And now, if thou wilt have me
for a husband, I will supply the loss of thy
merchant, and all the rest of thy relations.
And she feigned reluctance: but after a while,
she dried her tears, and consented.  But that
Rajpoot almost went out of his mind, so great
was his delight.  And one day he told her of
Wáránasí, and the burning of Kasháyiní.
And she looked at him with laughing eyes,
and said: O my husband, I will make up to
thee for the loss of Kasháyiní: for I am just
as beautiful as she.

And as Natabhrúkutí ended, she leaned
forward, and gazed at Aja with soft seductive
eyes, till he blushed, and wavered before her
like the flame of a candle in a wind.  For her
beauty bewildered him, and her cunning story
planted, as if against his will, the seed of
suspicion in his mind.  And in spite of himself,
he said to himself: What if it were as she says,
and my wife, like another Kasháyiní, were
concealing from me something that she shrank
from avowing, lest I should think the worse
of her.  And he turned pale at the thought,
that any other lover should, even a very little,
have occupied her heart before him.  And he
stood silent, and confused, striving to expel
from his mind the doubt that Natabhrúkutí
had raised in it, saying to himself: Can I really
be only the last of many lovers?  And all the
while Natabhrúkutí watched him, devouring
him as it were with her eyes.  And at last, she
said again: Sweet boy, thou art too young and
too honest to cope with women, who were
framed by the Creator to deceive.  But Aja
said angrily: Thou art thyself a woman,
seeking at this very moment to deceive me: and as
for thy age, it is less than my own.  And she
said: Nay, nay: I am older, for I am wiser
than thyself.  For when I see my husband, I
remember him, but me thou hast utterly
forgotten, thy true and only wife.  Ah! foolish
one, thou hast forgotten.  And thou resemblest
one, who casts away a costly jewel, for
the sake of a bit of glass, shining only in the
sunlight of thy ignorance, and trodden by the
foot of every passing stranger.  What! can
I do nothing to rouse thy recollection?  Look
at me well! look hard, and it may be,
something of me will touch as it were a chord in
thy soul.
</p>

<p>
And she came up close to him, so that the
warmth and fragrance of her beauty enveloped
him like an atmosphere of intoxication.
And she joined her hands, looking up into his
face, as it were compelling his reluctant
admiration by her humble submission to his will.
And she said: Hast thou, hast thou indeed
forgotten all?  And as he gazed at her, two huge
drops of crystal welled into her eyes, and hung
poised before they fell on the net of her long
dark lashes.  And she said: Thou sayest, I
am seeking to deceive thee.  I love thee, and
where is the deception?  Is it not rather thou
that art the deceiver in this matter?  Is it any
fault of mine if another has stepped in to
defraud me of thyself?  Or am I to be blamed,
if thy beauty still beguiles me as it did long
ago?  And yet, dost thou accuse me as if I
were a criminal?  O blue black bee, what is
this behaviour, that thou seekest as it were to
pick a quarrel with the poor red lotus who
loves thee but too well?  And she smiled
through her tears, and exclaimed: Ah! but in
spite of thee, I will adore thee, whether thou
wilt or no.  Ha! and I will compel thee to
remember, and force my way through every
barrier and obstacle till I reach the recollection[<a id="chap0410fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0410fn1">1</a>]
in the bottom of thy heart.  O canst thou
not remember the days of long ago, when my
now despised beauty was a joy to thee, and
my hair a very net to snare thy willing soul,
and my eyes were more to thee than any
diamonds, and these two arms were thy prison
and thy chain, and this agitated bosom was thy
pillow on which I lulled thee to slumber with
the music of this very voice?  Hast thou really
forgotten the nectar of my kiss? hast thou
actually forgotten thy own insatiable thirst?
Ah! but if thou hast forgotten, I have not:
and the innumerable multitudes of thy too
delicious kisses come back to me, singing in
my memory, and whispering in my soul like
the lisping of the sea.  Hark!  Dost thou not
hear them also, those voices of a former birth?

<p>
And as Aja gazed at her, stunned and almost
overcome by the pathos of her irresistible
appeal, and as it were swept from his feet by
the surge of her passion, suddenly she seized
his left hand with her right, and stood,
grasping it as if convulsively, with the other hand
raised, and bending her head, as if to listen.
And he listened, and lo! there sounded in his
ears a murmur resembling that of the sea,
mixed with faint strains of music, and echoes
of indistinguishable singing voices coming as
it were from the ends of the earth.  And a
shudder ran through him, as she turned, and
looked at him as if in ecstasy, with eyes that
saw nothing, murmuring in an eager voice
that chanted and charmed his ear like the
rushing of a stream: Dost thou hear the
voices, calling thee over to the other shore?
For the sea is the sea of separation, and the
other shore is our former birth.  Far away
over the setting sun hides the red land[<a id="chap0411fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0411fn1">1</a>] of our
old sweet love.  And I can take thee back to
it, out of this dim and dingy wood.  Only I
can carry thee back to the land beyond the
sunset hill, where love is lying dead.  Over
the sea where monsters lurk, and great pearls
grow in sunless deeps, I can carry thee back
again to the land of long ago.  Never a ship
with a silken sail could rock thee over across the
waves so well as I will waft thee there on the
swell of this soft breast.  Never a breeze from
the sandal hill could ferry thee over a silent
sea so gently as will I, by breathing into thy
raptured ear tales of thy old forgotten past
with fond and fragrant lips.  What! art thou
still oblivious of that old delicious birth?  Dost
thou never behold in dreams the paradise of
our little hut, and slake again thy raging thirst
in a long forbidden kiss?  Does she never
come back to thee, the Brahmani girl with a
face like mine, with lips that laughed and eyes
that shone, and a mango flower in her hair?
Say, dost thou never dream of her?  And she
shook his arm with frenzy, and exclaimed:
Ha! wake from thy magic sleep, and tear
away the curtain that hides me from thy
blinded soul.  I will, I will awake thee.  I
will not be forgotten.  And all at once, she
burst into a passion of tears.  And she reeled,
as though about to fall, and tottered, and
threw herself, sobbing hard, against his breast.
</p>

<p>
And while she spoke, Aja stood, like one
pushed to the very edge of a precipice, pale
as death, and breathing hard, spellbound.
And then at last, when she threw herself upon
his breast, again a shudder ran through all his
limbs.  And as if her touch had shattered to
pieces the last fragment of his resolution, he
caught her around the waist with the one
arm that was free.  And with tears in his own
eyes, he stammered, as if in the extremity of
desperation, hardly knowing what he said:
Alas!  I have been harsh to thee.  O lovely
browed beauty, cease to weep.  Why, O why,
did I not meet thee sooner by only a single day?

</p>

<p>
And at that very moment, he heard behind
him a deep sigh.  And as he turned, wood,
poppies, and all vanished from before his eyes.
Once more he stood on the city wall; and there
before him was the King's daughter.  And she
was standing in the doorway through which
he had come upon the wall, leaning against
the open door, and paler than Love's own
ashes, while her great dark eyes were frozen
as it were to ice, and yet lit up by the triple fire
of sorrow and reproach and fierce disdain.
And she looked like the daughter of Janaka,
when forsaken by the lord of the race of
Raghu, and like the heavenly Urwashi, when
abandoned by Pururawas, a very spirit of
despair carved by the Creator into a stony
female form, to break the heart of the three
worlds.  And as if the very sight of her had
broken the spell that held him, reason and
recollection suddenly returned to Aja, as it
were at a single bound.  And he woke, as if
from a magic sleep, and on the instant, a
sword ran as it were straight into his heart.
And with a cry, he flung away his sobbing
burden like a blade of grass, not caring where
it fell: and ran towards the King's daughter.
But she, when she saw him coming, shrieked,
and started, and exclaimed: Away!  Touch
me not, save with the point of thy sharp true
sword, to pierce me through the body as thy
perfidy has my soul.
</p>

<p>
Then Aja tossed away his sword, with a
shudder, over the edge of the wall.  And he
seized himself by the head with both hands,
with a groan like the roar of a wounded lion.
And he exclaimed: Ha!  Better now it had
been indeed, had I never emerged from the
waste of sand.  And he turned fiercely upon
Natabhrúkutí, saying: This is thy doing, thou
vile enchantress: and now I am indeed awake.
</p>

<p>
But even as he spoke, the words died away
upon his lips; and he stood still, like a picture
on a wall, for wonder at what he saw before
him.  For Natabhrúkutí was standing still,
exactly where he left her, bolt upright, like a
spear fixed in the earth.  And her beauty was
greater than ever, and yet such, that as he saw
it, his heart stopped in his breast.  For every
vestige of the nectar of her love-emotion had
left her, and in its place, the poison of
immortal hate shone in her cold and evil eyes, which
were fastened, as if with a mixture of pain
and pleasure, with a glittering and fiendish
stare, upon the King's daughter.  And as he
watched them, cold ran in Aja's veins.  For
her eyes shook, and changed colour, and a
horrible smile played on her blue and twitching
lips.  And she looked thin, for her two arms
hung down tight against her sides, and her
fingers opened and shut, slowly, as if of their
own accord.
</p>

<p>
And after a while, she spoke.  And she
turned to Aja, and said, in a voice that
resembled a hiss: Fool! thou wouldst not take
the blue flower I offered thee, though its
fragrance could not have been matched by
anything in the three worlds.  Now, then, I will
take another way.  So as he watched her, she
was gone: and he saw before him nothing but
the empty city wall.
</p>

<p>
And as he looked again, not crediting the
testimony of his own eyes, he heard a sharp
cry from the King's daughter.  And he
turned, and saw Yashowatí sinking to the
ground.  And at that very moment Natabhrúkutí
stood again before him.  And she
looked at him with strange eyes, and said
slowly: Go now, and enjoy thy wife.  But I
must give thee just one kiss, before I go.
</p>

<p>
And as Aja looked into her eyes, suddenly,
like a flash of lightning, he understood.  And
he struck his hand upon his brow, exclaiming:
Ha!  Now, now, I understand, too late.  Thou
art that very she, that was jealous of the King's
daughter's beauty, and ruined her out of spite.
And I have been befooled by thee, and failed
to stand the test.  And he ground his teeth
with rage, that swept through him like a storm.
And he said to himself: Alas!  I threw away
my sword.  No matter.  Now, then, as she
said herself, I will take another way.
And he looked at her, as she stood waiting.
And he held out his arms, saying: Come, then.
And as she put her face close to his own, he
caught her by her slender throat, with both
hands, in a grip like that of death.
</p>

<p>
And then lo! she was gone again.  But in
her place, he held in his grasp a huge yellow
snake, which struck him, as he clutched it
hard, once and twice, upon the lips.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
A Fatal Kiss
</h3>

<p>
And then, little by little, the night
gradually came to an end.  And the sun rose up,
out of his home in the eastern mountain, and
began rapidly to climb into the sky.
</p>

<p>
And all at once, there arose a great hubbub,
and an outcry in the King's palace.  And the
women ran hither and thither, wailing and
screaming and crying out: Haha! haha! the
daughter of the King is gone.  And they
hunted in all directions, but could not find her
anywhere: and they went and told the King.
But he, when he heard it, came running just
as he was in his night clothes, and hurried
about with all the women, looking into every
corner, and finding nothing.  So after
turning the palace upside down, he stopped short.
And he said: What if she should have followed
her lover up on to the city wall, and shared his
fate!  For beyond a doubt, like all his
predecessors, he has vanished never to return.
</p>

<p>
Then they all went up the winding stair, the
King going first.  And he stepped out on to
the wall.  And instantly, with a piercing cry,
he fell to the ground in a mortal swoon.
</p>

<p>
Then terror seized on all those women, and
they stood exactly where they were, looking at
each other with pale faces, not daring to
advance.  But at last, after a long while,
supporting each the other, they pushed forward
and looked out.  And they saw the King's
body, lying on that of his daughter; and a
little further off, Aja, lying upon his face.
</p>

<p>
Then they went out, and took up those three
bodies, and carried them in, and examined
them.  And after a while, they said: Doubtless
the heart of the old King broke, when he
saw his daughter lying dead.  But as for the
other two, one snake has evidently bitten both.
And yet, this is a wonderful thing.  For she
has been bitten on the foot, but her lover upon
the lips.  What then?  Was he trying to kiss
the snake, that it should bite him upon the
lips?  For how could even the biggest snake
reach up so high, as this great Rajpoot's
mouth?

"The foundation of Mr. Galsworthy's talent, it
seems to me, lies in a remarkable power of ironic
insight combined with an extremely keen and faithful
eye for all the phenomena, on the surface of the
life he observes.  These are the purveyors of his
imagination, whose servant is a style clear, direct,
sane, illumined by a perfectly unaffected sincerity.
It is the style of a man whose sympathy with
mankind is too genuine to allow him the smallest
gratification of his vanity at the cost of his fellow
creatures, ... sufficiently pointed to carry
deep his remorseless irony, and grave enough to be
the dignified vehicle of his profound compassion.
Its sustained harmony is never interrupted by those
bursts of cymbals and fifes which some deaf people
acclaim for brilliance.  Mr. Galsworthy will never
be found futile by anyone and never uninteresting

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
